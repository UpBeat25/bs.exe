2/15/22, 3:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: ryan is planning to create a hydrochloric acid factory
2/15/22, 3:41 PM - Dev: <Media omitted>
2/15/22, 3:42 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: isn't that methane tho?
2/15/22, 3:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: earlier he wanted to see if he can farm it from humans but realized killing humans is bad
2/15/22, 3:42 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: üòÇüòÇ
2/15/22, 3:42 PM - Dev: ü§£
2/15/22, 3:42 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: my guy is planning world domination

2/15/22, 3:43 PM - Dev: What he gonna do with it tho
2/15/22, 3:44 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: world domination
2/15/22, 3:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: when we were revising acids bases and salts mam talked about acid rain

ryan was disappointed to learn that the acids present in the rain weren't concentrated enough

so now he wants to create a factory to mass-produce hydrochloric acid so he can make it truly acid rain
2/15/22, 3:44 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
2/15/22, 3:44 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ahhaha yes
2/15/22, 3:44 PM - Dev: I literally asked ma'am about the school thing at 12 had she still hasn't replied
2/15/22, 3:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: oof
2/15/22, 3:45 PM - Dev: Oh
2/15/22, 3:45 PM - Dev: Smart
2/15/22, 3:45 PM - Dev: But like it's kinda a win win idea
2/15/22, 3:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: he can spray hydrochloric acid on all of us
2/15/22, 3:45 PM - Dev: Yhea
2/15/22, 3:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: then once we die he can use our stomach to farm more acid
2/15/22, 3:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: so he can do the same for aliens
2/15/22, 3:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: and eventually he will dominate the universe

2/15/22, 3:49 PM - Dev: That's what she said
2/15/22, 3:49 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: can I buy him from you
2/15/22, 3:50 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: what
2/15/22, 3:50 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: how does that even?
2/15/22, 3:50 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: where's the reference

2/15/22, 3:52 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: can you tell me the company
2/15/22, 3:52 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: please
2/15/22, 3:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: i don't know
2/15/22, 3:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: he's older than me and probably older than my brother
2/15/22, 3:53 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: h
2/15/22, 3:53 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: cchexk his tG
2/15/22, 3:53 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: tagg
2/15/22, 3:53 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: check
2/15/22, 3:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: he doesn't have one
2/15/22, 3:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: he is the only true todd
2/15/22, 3:53 PM - Dev: Factss
2/15/22, 3:54 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: may I buy yours?
2/15/22, 3:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
2/15/22, 3:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: I refuse
2/15/22, 3:57 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: dude
2/15/22, 3:57 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: please
2/15/22, 3:57 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: he's literally so cute
2/15/22, 3:57 PM - Ryan: I believe the recipe is for methamphetamine
2/15/22, 3:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: dude lmao
2/15/22, 3:57 PM - Ryan: Also called meth
2/15/22, 3:57 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yes my bad
2/15/22, 3:58 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: methane is gas
2/15/22, 3:58 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: world domination? ü§®ü§®ü§®
2/15/22, 3:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: one of the components is dilute hcl
2/15/22, 3:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: ahhhhh so that's why you were asking if we can farm hcl from humans
2/15/22, 4:01 PM - Ryan: Hmm is the recipe true?

I don't think
2/15/22, 4:02 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: It is
2/15/22, 4:02 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: tried it before
2/15/22, 4:02 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: worked very well
2/15/22, 4:02 PM - Ryan: It is illegal to share information for creating things like a nuclear reactor, drugs etc I think
2/15/22, 4:03 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: also before buying E1-0-E1 make sure the bottle says "high ethyl ether content"
2/15/22, 4:03 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: might be
2/15/22, 4:03 PM - Ryan: ok
2/15/22, 4:03 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: oküëçüèª
2/15/22, 4:04 PM - Ryan: I also have one more doubt
2/15/22, 4:04 PM - Ryan: What is the length of the radius and ulna
2/15/22, 4:05 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: for methamphetamine?
2/15/22, 4:05 PM - Ryan: And can I put a human spine in the arm

To increase joint flexibility
2/15/22, 4:05 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: which solution bro?
2/15/22, 4:07 PM - Ryan: The spine contains a lot of nerves and is the pathway for the nervous system I think
2/15/22, 4:07 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: WHICH SOLUTION??? üòÉüòÉüî´üî´üî´
2/15/22, 4:07 PM - Ryan: Can I connect those nerves to the spinal cord of another person
2/15/22, 4:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: it is not
2/15/22, 4:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: we have a fair bit of information on how to create nuclear bombs, drugs
2/15/22, 4:08 PM - Dev: No
2/15/22, 4:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: the problem is getting the material
2/15/22, 4:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: and mass producing
2/15/22, 4:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: w h a t t h e f
2/15/22, 4:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: how will you?
2/15/22, 4:09 PM - Dev: Mo the muscles won't be able to handle that
2/15/22, 4:09 PM - Dev: He can't
2/15/22, 4:09 PM - Ryan: Think

It can increase the flexibility of the forearm
2/15/22, 4:09 PM - Dev: It cant
2/15/22, 4:10 PM - Dev: It will actually make the arm paralyzed
2/15/22, 4:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: ryan's search history: "how to create meth at home" "how to create a nuclear reactor at home" "how to farm hydrochloric acid from human bodies which are in my basement" "how to steal a spinal cord"
2/15/22, 4:10 PM - Ryan: From nerve damage?
2/15/22, 4:11 PM - Dev: Yhea and like the human barin is not ment to cotroll that much of flexibility in the foresrm
2/15/22, 4:11 PM - Dev: *forearm
2/15/22, 4:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: @919717944490 is this true
2/15/22, 4:12 PM - Dev: The last one tho
2/15/22, 4:12 PM - Ryan: I don't know

2/15/22, 4:16 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: no
2/15/22, 4:16 PM - Ryan: I think there is a theory out there called conduction of vibrations

It said that vibrations can easily travel through metals
2/15/22, 4:16 PM - Dev: It can
2/15/22, 4:17 PM - Ryan: So if a metal wire is attached to the eardrum

And there is a metal surface at the end of it

Will the eardrum explode
2/15/22, 4:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
2/15/22, 4:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: sure
2/15/22, 4:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: it would

2/16/22, 9:02 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: for world domination
2/16/22, 9:02 AM - Ryan: A single space changed the whole meaning

The use less group probably means to reduce the use of things

The useless group is useless

2/16/22, 9:06 AM - Anant Tiwari: trinitrotoluene
2/16/22, 9:07 AM - Dev: Got to the beach and get sand and kill come people for some gunpowder
2/16/22, 9:07 AM - Dev: *some
2/16/22, 9:07 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: /give Brawly minecraft_tnt 60000000000
2/16/22, 9:07 AM - Anant Tiwari: thanks
2/16/22, 9:07 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: */gave brawly 60000000 tnt*
2/16/22, 9:07 AM - Anant Tiwari: i wonder how much a minecraft block of tnt weighs
2/16/22, 9:07 AM - Dev: Ok
2/16/22, 9:07 AM - Dev: I think a 80kg
2/16/22, 9:07 AM - Dev: A!
2/16/22, 9:10 AM - Dev: Who will win in the fight of Russia and Ukraine
2/16/22, 9:10 AM - Parth: Stupid question ofc Russia
2/16/22, 9:10 AM - Dev: America is in the favor of Ukraine
2/16/22, 9:10 AM - Anant Tiwari: considering volume is 1u¬≥ and u = m, and tnt is 1.65g / cm¬≥,

√ó 1k = 1.65kg
√ó 1k = 1650kg = 1.65t

so considering i asked for 650,000 kg aka 650 tons, 394 blocks of TNT would fulfill my requirement
2/16/22, 9:11 AM - Anant Tiwari: considering volume of a block*
2/16/22, 9:11 AM - Dev: No
2/16/22, 9:11 AM - Anant Tiwari: in minecraft*
2/16/22, 9:11 AM - Anant Tiwari: so darash gave me 60 million blocks of TNT
2/16/22, 9:11 AM - Dev: Bro Steve has to be jacked to carry a stack of tnt
2/16/22, 9:11 AM - Parth: Yeah but America wont even give his half power so Russia
2/16/22, 9:12 AM - Dev: I mean like there is a lot going on in Russia and America
2/16/22, 9:12 AM - Parth: Yeah kinda
2/16/22, 9:12 AM - Dev: Like America has more than double the weapons than russia
2/16/22, 9:12 AM - Anant Tiwari: 99 million √ó 1.65k = 99 billion tons = 99 megatons = 2 tsar bombas
2/16/22, 9:12 AM - Anant Tiwari: @919999373163
2/16/22, 9:12 AM - Dev: Almost triple

2/16/22, 9:15 AM - Dev: This message was deleted
2/16/22, 9:15 AM - Anant Tiwari: considering you can have an enderchest with 30 shulker boxes, and 39 shulker boxes possible in your inventory

we have 69 shulker boxes of space

one shulker box has free space of 64 √ó 30 = 640 √ó 3 = 1920

1920 √ó 69 = 132,480 blocks of TNT

132,480 √ó 1.65k = 218,592,000kg = steve can carry 218.6 million kg of TNT in his entire inventory
2/16/22, 9:16 AM - Siddharth: classes are going

2/16/22, 9:18 AM - Anant Tiwari: meaning steve can deliver a payload with the equivalent detonation power of 0.2kt

if you get 60 players, then you could carry enough TNT in one trip to deploy a hiroshima bomb equivalent TNT in minecraft
2/16/22, 9:18 AM - Parth: Chilin
2/16/22, 9:18 AM - Ryan: And to destroy your pc

2/16/22, 9:21 AM - Anant Tiwari: i wonder how long of AFKing it would take to collect enough gunpowder to get enough TNT using the best possible gundpowder farm in minecraft to get as much tnt as to the equivalent of a Tsar Bomba

you'd need many many slaves to do nothing but mine sand using shovels all day, and you'd need many many creeper farms for months

2/21/22, 9:05 AM - Anant Tiwari: but what is h? well, h is the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th... screw it I'm not doing this i don't care which number the letter h comes at, all i do know is that it is an alphabet of the English language

but what is English? a language? well, in linguistics there are well defined rules on exactly what a dialect is, but not what a language is. This still doesn't mean that English simply doesn't exist, because I am using it right now, and no one cares what the linguists have to say.

2/27/22, 3:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: 636 here
2/27/22, 3:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: lemme see
2/27/22, 3:22 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: nic
2/27/22, 3:22 PM - Dev: What to fund here
2/27/22, 3:22 PM - Dev: Like what to find here
2/27/22, 3:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: find BF
2/27/22, 3:22 PM - Siddharth: Its not a Parallelogram
2/27/22, 3:22 PM - Dev: Ok
2/27/22, 3:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: the figure is very wrong so first step should be to draw a more accurate figure on paper
2/27/22, 3:22 PM - Siddharth: Ok
2/27/22, 3:23 PM - Dev: I think they are trying out use EC as the length?
2/27/22, 3:24 PM - Siddharth: Yes,I think so
2/27/22, 3:24 PM - Dev: But shape I'd not correct
2/27/22, 3:24 PM - Siddharth: Yea
2/27/22, 3:24 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: Area of Parallelogram ABCD Basex Height

Base = AB and Height = CE

= AB x CE

= (18 x 10) cm¬≤

180 cm¬≤

Now let Base = AD and Height BF Area of Parallelogram ABCD = Base x Height

= AD x BF

180 = 12 x BF

‚áíBF = 180 12

BF = 15 m
2/27/22, 3:24 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: base into height*
2/27/22, 3:24 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: first line
2/27/22, 3:24 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: @918929020721
2/27/22, 3:25 PM - Siddharth: Thx
2/27/22, 3:25 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: you're siddarth right?
2/27/22, 3:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: he is
2/27/22, 3:25 PM - Siddharth: Yes
2/27/22, 3:25 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: üëåüëåüëå
2/27/22, 3:25 PM - Siddharth: Thx a lot
2/27/22, 3:25 PM - Siddharth: Guys
2/27/22, 3:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: ye?
2/27/22, 3:26 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: come well
2/27/22, 4:31 PM - Siddharth: <Media omitted>
2/27/22, 4:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: okay
2/27/22, 4:33 PM - Siddharth: Thx
2/27/22, 4:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: area of triangle is 1/2 * b * h

base is 40cm

height can be found using trig

height is opposite, adj is 20cm and hypotenuse is 40cm, main angle is 60¬∞ because 180 / 3

so sine(60) = x / 40
0.866 = x / 40
34.64 = x
x = ~34.6

so now 1/2 * 40 * 34.6 = 7.3m¬≤

3/11/22, 6:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: and you don't get to type in computer
3/11/22, 6:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: and normally 7-9 chapters come in each subject by 7th-8th
3/11/22, 6:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: but we get 4-6
3/11/22, 6:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: and we didn't properly do a lot of chapters
3/11/22, 6:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: only done as activities
3/11/22, 6:57 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: hmmm...
3/11/22, 6:57 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: kyu nahi karaya unhone?
3/11/22, 6:57 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: few chapters

rest activites were art and craft based
3/11/22, 6:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: because internet issues so chapters are more slow to complete, harder to check for notebook submission and most don't do it etc etc
3/11/22, 6:58 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: bhai poore saal internet issues thodi na honge
3/11/22, 6:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: obv
3/11/22, 6:58 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: to wo unki fault
3/11/22, 6:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: but still they do make us do more chapters
3/11/22, 6:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: in offline
3/11/22, 6:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: so i don't get your point
3/11/22, 6:59 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: meh

3/11/22, 7:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: this is the original points

3/11/22, 7:01 PM - Dev: Kya beat ho rhe hai
3/11/22, 7:01 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: jitna humko karaya hai, utna hi humko syllabus lagta hau
3/11/22, 7:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: so now they're compensating by longer timings for offline
3/11/22, 7:01 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yes
3/11/22, 7:01 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: "gaps"

3/13/22, 8:51 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: he decide
3/13/22, 8:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: i could say the same about the apocalypse thing

<essays>
and tbh now I want to write the whole thing I wanted to write yesterday, but didn't because I was too tired to want to respond.

you picking out random msg from January about how I said "isro is better!!!!" when the main discussion was about ULA and ESA vs SpaceX, when I was probably saying it sarcastically (both ISRO and ULA tbh, because both of them are worse than SpaceX in a few things) or I had lost it, when what I was saying about parth was how he was becoming so much of an Elon fanboy

tl;dr: I didn't conclude that conversation with saying ULA / ISRO > SpaceX, I said ULA > SpaceX in some things, SpaceX > ULA in some things, Parth was just taking that sentence out of context and making fun of it. That's fine.

<quote> @‚Å®Anant Tiwari‚Å© bhai I don't want to talk to you either, but leave karne se kuch nahi hogaa

if you leave again then parth kabhi add hi nahi karega

you're the one who leaves when you're losing an arguement

jab kuch bolne ko nahi hota so you leave and then we're the one who apologize </quote>

I can't blame you for thinking this, I should've written some sort of thing like I was too tired to write more

I just left because I didn't want to deal with it

"you're the one who leaves when you're losing an arguement" well now that I've written all of this, I don't think either of us were winning the argument, I left because I didn't want to continue it at the time

so yeah those were the things I wanted to write yesterday. </essays>
3/13/22, 8:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: wtf that's way more than i expected

3/13/22, 8:54 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: plus I wasn't the only one
3/13/22, 8:54 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: parth bhi tha
3/13/22, 8:54 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: im not blaming parth
3/13/22, 8:54 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: Im just saying that he was with me so basically Im blaming both of us
3/13/22, 8:54 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: okay you were tired

3/27/22, 10:29 PM - Dev: Oh k
3/27/22, 10:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: Good question

I am currently performing a task called "breathing", where a person inhales oxygen and exhales cO2 [Carbon Dioxide].

I am also using my hands to write this message so that I can answer your question and my legs seem to be cramped because I performed a task called "walking", where a person uses both of their legs and switches them time to time each step.

I just consumed some nutrients 20 minutes ago, the task for this is called "eating", where a person puts food into their mouth and chews onto it using their mouth and then digest it so that one can function its brain.
3/27/22, 10:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: using their teeth*

My brain was walking the dishes thus causing me to make this mistake me

I apologize for such behavior
3/27/22, 10:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: remove the word "me" from 2nd line

as said earlier, my brain was walking the dishes

3/30/22, 10:20 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: this is very confusing
3/30/22, 10:20 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: my dad's car uses diesel and  the prices are very low compared to petrol
3/30/22, 10:20 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: I'm saying this because my mom usually drives us school and her car uses petrol so.......

she said that petrol is costly and the school is very far away from here

3/30/22, 10:27 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yeah

4/12/22, 8:13 PM - Dev: Anant do be typing
4/12/22, 8:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: goal of the game:

there are a bunch of tiles with hidden bombs, you have to click every blue tile on the field without clicking any of the bombs (you can place flags on the tiles you which have bombs by long pressing)

so how do you find the bombs?

see the tiles with numbers, they tell you how many bombs are in a 1 tile radius around it

so using a bunch of logic you can figure out which tile is safe to click and which is not
4/12/22, 8:14 PM - Dev: Thanks

4/12/22, 11:03 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ah
4/12/22, 11:03 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: prolly
4/12/22, 11:05 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: imagine having a babysitter

I grew up with "don't open the door unless it's me"
4/12/22, 11:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: ok
4/12/22, 11:06 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: what
4/12/22, 11:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: i don't know

4/12/22, 11:08 PM - Dev: So as anant and I did not come to school for a week, I think ma'am has already shuffled the benches so there is a chance anant and I can sit together
4/12/22, 11:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: yeah
4/12/22, 11:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: maybe we'll sit at the end
4/12/22, 11:09 PM - Dev: True
4/12/22, 11:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: but then also
4/12/22, 11:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: i am still mildly blind

4/12/22, 11:11 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: people in our class could barely see the board including me

I had to squint my eyes
4/12/22, 11:11 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: I'm turning blind
4/12/22, 11:15 PM - Dev: Get glasses
4/12/22, 11:17 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
4/12/22, 11:18 PM - Dev: <Media omitted>
4/12/22, 11:19 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
4/12/22, 11:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: 60% of people in the world need glasses
4/12/22, 11:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: but don't realize they do
4/12/22, 11:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: especially considering the stigma about young children having glasses

it is not due to phones, it is due to how our society works now which involves so much close up work
4/12/22, 11:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: especially at a young age
4/12/22, 11:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: which worsens our eyes
4/12/22, 11:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: but indian parents dont understand
4/12/22, 11:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: which is why we have people like me who've managed to get almost -7s.but trust me that slight inconvenience of wearing glasses early on is much better than being blind and being forced to wear them
4/12/22, 11:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: later
4/12/22, 11:27 PM - Dev: True
4/12/22, 11:28 PM - Dev: And the parents just blame it on phones
4/12/22, 11:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: I belive that your vision is dependent on the size of your eye?
4/12/22, 11:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yes
4/12/22, 11:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: h = sqrt(4h / h((h¬≤)‚Å¥ + (1 * 0))) / (1 / h)
4/12/22, 11:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: distance between lens and retina
4/12/22, 11:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: or strength of eye lens
4/12/22, 11:41 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yes

Can it produce it infinitely
2/15/22, 10:23 AM - Anant Tiwari: oxyntic cells

water and carbon dioxide combine within the cell and you get carbonic acid, some other things happen and you get hydrochloric acid
2/15/22, 10:23 AM - Anant Tiwari: if you feed the person infinitely then yes
2/15/22, 11:12 AM - Ryan: Hmm so you can farm hydrochloric acid from a person?

2/15/22, 11:14 AM - Dev: K
2/15/22, 11:16 AM - Anant Tiwari: I don't see why you couldn't

5/6/22, 6:21 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: loll
5/6/22, 6:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
5/6/22, 6:40 PM - Dev: I really hope when the classes shuffled I don't get in class with kunal and Aditya sharma
5/6/22, 6:41 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: lol
5/6/22, 6:41 PM - Dev: Kunal kinda annoying and Aditya sharma kinda dumb
5/6/22, 6:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: i don't think shuffling will happen with everyone
5/6/22, 6:49 PM - Dev: Hm pretty sure the class will be divided into 2
5/6/22, 6:53 PM - Dev: Cause there are 42 people in our class
5/6/22, 6:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: classes can support like 35 people
5/6/22, 6:58 PM - Dev: Hm there will be like 1 more class and like some students for every class will be there
5/6/22, 7:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes so

8 sections already

8 √ó 4 = 32

so 4 students from each class probably get shuffled
5/6/22, 7:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: to nrw class
5/6/22, 7:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: mam said probably French people will get shuffled
5/6/22, 7:43 PM - Dev: My chance of getting is 1in 11 cause there are 13  students of French in our class so 2 will be shuffled so 1 in 11
5/6/22, 7:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: what if its a bit more alphabetical wise
5/6/22, 7:44 PM - Dev: Probably sure there are only like 10 sanskrit in 8h
5/6/22, 7:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: so higher chance for those who have closer letter name beginning
5/6/22, 7:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: no...
5/6/22, 7:44 PM - Dev: In 8g
5/6/22, 7:44 PM - Dev: Lol
5/6/22, 7:45 PM - Dev: So then probably adrick, Arnav and bhoomi
5/6/22, 7:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: 21 sanskrit
5/6/22, 7:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: students
5/6/22, 7:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: so half half

6/17/22, 11:02 PM - Dev: @918929020721 tell the song lyrics
6/17/22, 11:03 PM - Siddharth: First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh

Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

First things first
Can you imagine what's about to happen?
It's Weezy the Dragon, I link with the Dragons
And we gon' get ratchet, no need for imaginin'

This is what's happenin'
Second thing second, I reckon immaculate
Sound about accurate
I know that strength, it don't come, don't come without strategy
I know the sweet, it don't come without cavities
I know the passages come with some traffic
I start with from the basement, end up in the attic
And third thing third
Whoever call me out, they simply can't count
Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this, huh

Is you a believer?
I get a unicorn out of a zebra
I wear my uniform like a tuxedo
This dragon don't hold his breath, don't need no breather
Love you Ms. Cita, the son of a leader
I know the bloomin' don't come without rain
I know the losin' don't come without shame
I know the beauty don't come without hurt

Hol' up, hol' up, last thing last
I know that Tunechi don't come without Wayne
I know that losin' don't come without game
I know that glory don't come without...
Don't come without...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Last things last
By the grace of fire and flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

t = 20

xii = 12 = j k l

l is first

xv = 15 = O

xv and xv again O and O

xiv = 14 = one before O = N

6/21/22, 5:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: LMAO THAT GUY
6/21/22, 5:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: XDDDDDDD
6/21/22, 5:53 PM - Dev: Yes
6/21/22, 6:03 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: is the stock market same as gambling?

stock market: you buy shares from a company becoming it's part owner and the money you invested depends on the performance of the company

so isn't that alike to gambling?

you put in your money for whatever game and your luck and performance depends on how much money you take back home?
6/21/22, 6:04 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: why don't they teach us about stock and taxes in school?
6/21/22, 6:09 PM - Dev: Good question but I do no
6/21/22, 6:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: stocks, if you are knowledgeable about the company you could make informed decisions on whether you think the company or the field is stupid or not, so not quite gambling

atleast I think gambling is like, imagine slot machines and RNG
6/21/22, 6:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: Taxes are not that complicated in India tbh, and if you're working on any business where you need to file special taxes you should probably get some financial advisor or whatever to do it. and commerce, finance, etc are subjects of streams which you can pick in 11th
6/21/22, 6:11 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: gambling from my opinion is

cards and stuff

or poker
6/21/22, 6:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: yeah, idk how it works but isn't RNG involved?
6/21/22, 6:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: random numbers
6/21/22, 6:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: compared to stonks
6/21/22, 6:12 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: very true, but I'm talking about the information

like, why don't they teach us that in school

why do we have to learn it manually
6/21/22, 6:12 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: perhaps
6/21/22, 6:12 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: when we grow up*
6/21/22, 6:12 PM - Dev: This message was deleted
6/21/22, 6:12 PM - Dev: Untrue
6/21/22, 6:12 PM - Anant Tiwari: that is very not true
6/21/22, 6:13 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i don't think so

isn't cricket solely based on skill?
6/21/22, 6:13 PM - Dev: Yes
6/21/22, 6:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: cricket is about physical strength + precision
6/21/22, 6:13 PM - Dev: I know but the people and rule say
6/21/22, 6:13 PM - Dev: Yes
6/21/22, 6:13 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: and isn't gambling based on luck

well based on the gamblers choice

some people cheat you
6/21/22, 6:13 PM - Dev: It is but idk
6/21/22, 6:13 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ‚úÖüòÉ
6/21/22, 6:13 PM - Dev: Very true
6/21/22, 6:14 PM - Dev: Gambling in inda is illegal but the Ada like dream1q
6/21/22, 6:14 PM - Dev: Dream11
6/21/22, 6:14 PM - Dev: And shit
6/21/22, 6:14 PM - Dev: They show ads of it
6/21/22, 6:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: they never taught us color theory, basics of construction of like buildings, didn't teach how to drive a car, parts of a rocket, derivation of formulas

if you're an artist, labourer, driver, aerospace engineer, mathematician, you'll think school is stupid for not covering <insert favorite topic>, but ofcourse they can't teach everything

but I do agree school teaches us a lot of useless things
6/21/22, 6:15 PM - Dev: Yes
6/21/22, 6:15 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: dream 11 is based on luck

you decide whether x cricket player goes on blah blah position or not

if you're correct, you get paid

like mostly luck
6/21/22, 6:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: yea... especially crypto scams
6/21/22, 6:15 PM - Dev: Yes
6/21/22, 6:15 PM - Dev: Crypto  is illegal in inda but there are sk many ads of it
6/21/22, 6:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: and we can pick WE, or go in clubs in school
6/21/22, 6:16 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: lmao

the things you listed

aren't they part of certain professions

I'm talking about taxes
no matter what your profession is

but do you know that I'm starting a new digital currency called "bitchcoin"

so that next time someone says

"I have no bitches"

I can tell them to go invest in the bitchcoin!

1 bitchcoin = 50,000 rupees
each time you invest in bitchcoin you get a bitch points!

bitch points are like cred points

6/22/22, 9:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: does c/c++ provide f-strings, and can you completely avoid dealing with memory, does c# let you run your code by writing one simple command in the terminal, does julia or whatever have as many great tutorials and learning resources as python, are there any good but simple game development frameworks for, idk ruby?

does python require you to define your class, main method, its arguments, return value, add semi-fucking-colons after every line except after some odd things, do you need to have header files to declare existence of every function, do you need to deal with compilation, linking, weird compiler flags, do you need to care about buffer under/overflows etc etc

in python the hello world program is ```print("Hello, world!")```

in c++ it is
```py
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	std::cout << "Hello, world!\n";
	return 0;
}```

which one do you think is less intimidating for new people? if you never coded, the only thing you'll find weird in python is "print" instead of something like "write", but you'll still understand what part of the line you can change without stuff breaking

but for c++... what is stdio.h? why those weird angle brackets, hashtags and other weird symbols? what is std::cout? what is return? why 0?

if you just want to learn how to sort an array, and just want to see the algorithm working on computer instead of paper, it makes much more sense to use python, you just want to be able to visualize it working asap

if you want to make flappy bird, it makes much more sense to use python, no matter what library you use you'll get 60 fps on your game, and it'll teach you all the basic ideas of game development

imagine doing that in C++... sure if you need the performance, if you're actually sorting an array with a million values or making minecraft then yeah python probably won't work well in those cases.

once you learn python, if you are genuinely interested in making large scale projects then go to higher performance languages, it's not too difficult to switch if you are willing to put the effort it

tl;dr: when people first program they want to see a window on the screen with things moving and cool stuff ASAP, not figuring out what header files are

6/25/22, 2:36 AM - Siddharth: Hello
6/25/22, 2:36 AM - Siddharth: or did I?

well, what do you consider writing a message? several things have to go right for one to write a message:

writing a message involves the connection between a client and a server, the client being the discord mobile app on my phone and the server being some various computers around the world which store my message. My phone makes a connection to that server and uses the TCP/IP, SSL and HTTP protocols to send the message. after the various servers sync the message data (such as raw text, meta file information) across them, they are marked as ready to be accessed from the various other clients comprising this server in  the form of members, such as you guys. your clients make a READ request to the server to serve them the data, and thus after a complicated set of procedures, the message displays on your screen
6/25/22, 2:36 AM - Siddharth: but, how does one write the message? as in, how do they give the server the information?

short answer: keyboard
long answer: keyboard
very long answer: they, the homo sapien making use of the service, opens whatever client they have, and uses the keyboard program on their device to send data across a local server which the discord client handles on it's own. the keyboard is actually not a board, but rather a panel which appears at the bottom of my phone's screen which shows the set of keys required to type a message. so, using my various muscles, joints, and overall my flexibility which allows my sub parts to perform locomotion, i force the tips of my fingers to come in contact with the position of the respective key on the phone screen
6/25/22, 2:36 AM - Siddharth: but how does the touch screen work? first, to answer that we have to answer what touch means

well, honestly?

touch on an atomic level does not make sense. it is rather a simple idea of abstraction we use to refer to various interactions happening between particles

There is used to describe position

Like "the bottle is there"

While "Their" is used to show possession

Like "their house"

So you would use "their spelling" as spelling is owned by a word, so it's like the word's possession

8/11/22, 8:46 PM - Suchit started a call
8/11/22, 8:58 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: x + 43 + x - 23 = 180
8/11/22, 8:59 PM - Suchit: 180 it's four side thing right
8/11/22, 8:59 PM - Suchit: ?
8/11/22, 8:59 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: quadrilateral ka total 360 hota hai

for interior
8/11/22, 8:59 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: üòÉ
8/11/22, 9:00 PM - Suchit: Means
8/11/22, 9:01 PM - Suchit: I don't get it
8/11/22, 9:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: there are 4 interior angles in a quadrilateral
8/11/22, 9:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: and the sum of their measures is 360¬∞
8/11/22, 9:02 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: da
8/11/22, 9:02 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: da
8/11/22, 9:02 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: dada
8/11/22, 9:02 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: doodoo
8/11/22, 9:03 PM - Suchit: For interior he says but he writes 180
8/11/22, 9:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ya so he is stupid
8/11/22, 9:04 PM - Suchit: Ok
8/11/22, 9:04 PM - Suchit: It means 90 degree each
8/11/22, 9:04 PM - Suchit: Huh?
8/11/22, 9:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: Not necessarily

They can be of different measures

If you make one angle smaller, then another will become bigger

So at the end of the day, the sum would be 360¬∞ only
8/11/22, 9:05 PM - Suchit: Question dekh
8/11/22, 9:05 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: at the end of the day
8/11/22, 9:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: In a quadrilateral, the sum of adjacent angles is 180¬∞

adjacent meaning next to each other

So in math terms, it means x + x + 43 - 23 = 180
Which is 2x + 20 = 180
So 2x = 180 - 20 = 160
x = 160 / 2 = 80
Therefore x = 80¬∞
8/11/22, 9:07 PM - Suchit: Thank you
8/11/22, 9:10 PM - Dev: Bhai mera bhi ye ans aaya
8/11/22, 9:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ya so it must be correct

Now I know what you people think I'll say "oh colonization is bad" or "they were mean to the Africans" but no, fuck Africans. They are irrelevant. I hate Africans, btu do you know what I hate more? French people. They are literal retards. Look at Czecho Slovakia in ww2, they said "help me France, help me France" and guess what France did, they said "honhonhon, I do not understand Germany you pomme de terre, honhonhon" and fucking ignored them letting Germany take over the whole nation. Napoleon raped the glorious Holy Roman EMpire 'til it died, literally destroying the power dynamic in Europe which lead to two world wars. And also, they eat frogs. FROGS. FUCK OFF WITH EATING LITERAL SWAMP ANIMALS. THATS UNACCEPTABLE, THINK OF HOW UNHYGIENIC THAT SHIT IS. Fuck French people, you are literally black. I do not like blacks, or French people.

9/12/22, 11:45 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: HAHAHHAHAHA
9/13/22, 3:11 AM - Anant Tiwari: what type of people thought that putting explosives in a titanium can, can be used to send someone to that circular thing in the sky
9/13/22, 3:11 AM - Anant Tiwari: like what
9/13/22, 3:12 AM - Anant Tiwari: first people somehow figured how far that round thingy is by finding earth's radius and using parallax effect and a lot of trigonometry
9/13/22, 3:12 AM - Anant Tiwari: they barely had paper back then
9/13/22, 3:13 AM - Anant Tiwari: literally they wrote stuff on stone by carving it out
9/13/22, 3:13 AM - Anant Tiwari: to find the radius they looked at shadows of poles at different places at same time

they were insane for communicating over 100s of km of harsh terrain in those times
9/13/22, 3:14 AM - Anant Tiwari: then some dudes figured out that the circle thing is also revolving around us

how is it revolving
how fast
why

what
9/13/22, 3:14 AM - Anant Tiwari: f = G m1m2 / r¬≤
9/13/22, 3:14 AM - Anant Tiwari: this formula was literally figured out by guessing
9/13/22, 3:15 AM - Anant Tiwari: newton guessed a formula then looked at stuff and wow turns out it's almost completely correct
9/13/22, 3:15 AM - Anant Tiwari: and some dude somehow thought
9/13/22, 3:15 AM - Anant Tiwari: yea like "what if we yeet something sideways at 30,000kmh, what will happen"
9/13/22, 3:16 AM - Anant Tiwari: and then called it falling with style ie orbiting

problem: atmosphere

so its impossible right
9/13/22, 3:16 AM - Anant Tiwari: so some dude was like
9/13/22, 3:16 AM - Anant Tiwari: lets get out of the atmosphere then
9/13/22, 3:16 AM - Anant Tiwari: "what"
"yes"
"are you high"
"yes"
9/13/22, 3:17 AM - Anant Tiwari: so like how do you fly

well that newton guy also figured out "damn reaction force is cool"
9/13/22, 3:17 AM - Anant Tiwari: so some guy found that heating certain chemicals kills you but if you do it properly it makes things get excited and they start moving
9/13/22, 3:18 AM - Anant Tiwari: then some guy used 100% of their brain power to imagine the geometrical shape for something called a crankshaft
9/13/22, 3:19 AM - Anant Tiwari: so like

you know that wheel thing which some other dudes made like 3 millenia ago

yea so what if we connect this weird shape to that wheel thing and then connect it to a bouncy thing called a piston which reciprocates by doing the whole thing called "combustion"
9/13/22, 3:19 AM - Anant Tiwari: damn so thats a car or something
9/13/22, 3:20 AM - Anant Tiwari: but small issue

car need contact with surface as wheel need contact
9/13/22, 3:20 AM - Anant Tiwari: so how do we like, get out of atmosphere with this thing
9/13/22, 3:20 AM - Anant Tiwari: some other dude was like

"spin the wheel so fast that the air is a road"
"please stop"
"No"
9/13/22, 3:21 AM - Anant Tiwari: and decided to call that a propeller
9/13/22, 3:22 AM - Anant Tiwari: and then with a lot of small bug fixing they got it very optimized

like "holy shit this is faster than a horse" optimized

"by 50x"
9/13/22, 3:22 AM - Anant Tiwari: but then the spinny thing

it go supersonic

but parts of it dont because air behaves weirdly at transonic velocities, whatever that may mean
9/13/22, 3:23 AM - Anant Tiwari: so some other dude was like oh yeah why don't we use that law thingy by the guy called newton, the third law
9/13/22, 3:23 AM - Anant Tiwari: so like instead of spinning a fan, just yeet stuff out
9/13/22, 3:23 AM - Anant Tiwari: and yeet stuff out they did
9/13/22, 3:24 AM - Anant Tiwari: tank to carry fuel

oxygen from air

some initial velocity and everything gets moving through the system and then a spark and BUSINESS IS BOOMING (or the fuel)

and the combustion products get yeeted, ie force is exerted on them

so reaction force is exerted on the tin can and the tin can move
9/13/22, 3:25 AM - Anant Tiwari: so like what if i move

what if i push air down

no no, that's cringe

what if i move AND push air down
9/13/22, 3:26 AM - Anant Tiwari: well the air is now colliding with this thing called a wing and getting pushed down, we lose a bit of speed horizontally but get vertical speed
9/13/22, 3:26 AM - Anant Tiwari: turns out that as you get further away from the ground, air pressure decreases because gravity, less particles etc

and less particle = less friction so yay we go faster now
9/13/22, 3:27 AM - Anant Tiwari: and then some people blew themselves up in the name of science to find more efficient fuels
9/13/22, 3:28 AM - Anant Tiwari: organic matter, coal

or pressurized gases to get everything running

then some dude was like what if i drill into the ocean

and they did

"oh whats this black thing"

*WELCOME TO THE AGE OF PETROLEUM*
9/13/22, 3:28 AM - Anant Tiwari: and then some people figured out how to separate it's stuff
9/13/22, 3:28 AM - Anant Tiwari: one of the components is kerosene
9/13/22, 3:28 AM - Anant Tiwari: hey lets try burning it
9/13/22, 3:28 AM - Anant Tiwari: *dies*
9/13/22, 3:28 AM - Anant Tiwari: so yea its a good fuel apparently

what if we use in plane and shit
9/13/22, 3:29 AM - Anant Tiwari: well now we improve combustion chamber design so it can cope with higher combustion temperature

metallurgy or something

cooling mechanisms

better aerodynamic profile for less air friction heat etc
9/13/22, 3:30 AM - Anant Tiwari: and damn now we have flying tin cans, amazing, but eh its just a cool toy lol
9/13/22, 3:30 AM - Anant Tiwari: and then someone drops explosives on you with it
9/13/22, 3:31 AM - Anant Tiwari: "damn this plane thing is cool"

so you improve it to win wars

plane is fast
plane can fly in many conditions
can carry a bunch of cargo

kinda expensive

so we improve plane to make the problem better

better plane = more bomb, faster = enemy die = you win

so like planes are poggers
9/13/22, 3:33 AM - Anant Tiwari: ok but like the cringe guys also figured out how to make their plane faster

like really fast so what do we do now

well hitting things causes damage. hitting them fast causes a lotta damage. to go faster, you need to fly higher

how do we fly higher? less air friction so it should be easier, but oh no there's no oxygen for my tin can to eat

wait i can just carry it lol

that works

not amazingly but it does
9/13/22, 3:38 AM - Anant Tiwari: welcome to rocket engines! using the hit new microbe found called yeast (ok we knew about it like a long time ago but shut up) we can make ethanol

ethanol is a poggers fuel

so lets improve the tin can, put a jet engine but remove air intake, add a tank for oxygen, liquefy that oxygen to make it denser and make rocket lighter, add actuated aerosurfaces for controlling airflow and attitude

and then yeet

welcome to v2 missile developed by wernher von braun, german prisoners and other wehrmacht scientists

wait oh yeah the whole going to space thing

thanks to newton's third law and this weird aircraft we can do that

so lets do it

JULY 1944 - - -

and we did it lol, it got to space

let's bomb some people now

MAY 1945 - - -

"turns out missiles are not useful if you can't aim them, if the enemy can trick you, if they are expensive"
9/13/22, 3:43 AM - Anant Tiwari: so lets focus a bit more on the prelude to this
9/13/22, 3:45 AM - Anant Tiwari: people found that to liquefy gas things you gotta cool them down or increase pressure

some scientists figured out that hydrogen burns very nicely and also very light which makes it a very ideal exhaust product for rockets, so the exhaust velocity is greater, and thus the engine efficiency is greater as the efficiency of a reaction engine is proportional to the exhaust velocity of the particles as faster moving exhaust would give more reaction force
9/13/22, 3:46 AM - Anant Tiwari: but hydrogen is a gas and a very un-dense one, so lets turn it into a liquid

some guy figure out how to do that in 1898

but only a bit so like we can't really make amazing using of it

we'll deal with it later
9/13/22, 3:46 AM - Anant Tiwari: kerosene is not quite there
9/13/22, 3:49 AM - Anant Tiwari: but ethanol is, a lot of ethanol is produced around the world, it's cheap and nice and it's a liquid so let's use it

now we have a good fuel, but that only really increases efficiency, not specific thrust

to increase thrust, we need to burn a lot of fuel instead, for which you need pumps

like stupidly powerful pumps

how do you power that pump

well it's 1870-1940 so like batteries aren't exactly a thing

but why do we need to store additional energy to the rocket in battery for powering pump, when the fuel itself has energy

so lets burn a bit of fuel to power the pump

so like, how does the fuel give the pump the movement? well the way was you literally put a rocket engine within a rocket engine
9/13/22, 3:50 AM - Anant Tiwari: and then you position the small rocket engines so it spins up the turbine

sounds stupid but welcome to rocket science
9/13/22, 3:51 AM - Anant Tiwari: ill finish this tomorrow
9/13/22, 3:51 AM - Anant Tiwari: or today I should say

9/15/22, 2:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: Sharad Mam said that the moon does not have an atmosphere

Define atmosphere

The moon has many particles suspended around it

How many is enough to be considered an atmosphere

Moon dust is extremely sharp because no water and stuff, and apparently a lot of it is suspended above the surface due to electrostatic force, maybe bombardment by radiation?

And if you move fast, this dust can damage your craft, damage equipment and tear spacesuits

So for a lot of effective purposes, the Moon has an atmosphere made of small glass-like shards
9/15/22, 2:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: I'd prefer to be hit by a trillion oxygen molecules per second than 10,000 glass shards

9/16/22, 9:31 PM - Aditya Vardhan: AI‚òï
9/16/22, 9:33 PM - Navya: coding‚òï‚òï‚òï
9/16/22, 9:34 PM - Aditya Vardhan: That's ai
9/16/22, 9:34 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Not coding
9/16/22, 9:34 PM - Aditya Vardhan: So
9/16/22, 9:34 PM - Aditya Vardhan: AI‚òï
9/16/22, 9:35 PM - Navya: coding‚òï
9/16/22, 9:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: AI is made by Coding
9/16/22, 9:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: So technically Navya is correct
9/16/22, 9:35 PM - Navya: lmaooooo
9/16/22, 9:35 PM - Aditya Vardhan: It kept a monkeys photo in my brother's album
9/16/22, 9:35 PM - Navya: ‚òï

9/16/22, 9:35 PM - Navya: <Media omitted>
9/16/22, 9:35 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Yeah but it's still ai
9/16/22, 9:35 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Way different
9/16/22, 9:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: made by Coding
9/16/22, 9:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: No not at all
9/16/22, 9:35 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Like ai thinks itself
9/16/22, 9:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: AI is just a type of program
9/16/22, 9:36 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Coding is coded
9/16/22, 9:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: And how is that implemented
9/16/22, 9:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: By various algorithms
9/16/22, 9:36 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Yes. But
9/16/22, 9:36 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Different
9/16/22, 9:36 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Very
9/16/22, 9:36 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Program can't diff between photos
9/16/22, 9:36 PM - Aditya Vardhan: But a program of ai can
9/16/22, 9:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: The ability to self-learn still needs to be implemented by creating a base

The base is composed of a lot of algorithms, data processing, maths

That's the difference
9/16/22, 9:36 PM - Aditya Vardhan: So
9/16/22, 9:36 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Yes
9/16/22, 9:36 PM - Aditya Vardhan: üòÉ
9/16/22, 9:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: That makes no sense
9/16/22, 9:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: AI is a program T
9/16/22, 9:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: There is literally no difference
9/16/22, 9:36 PM - Aditya Vardhan: I literally said that
9/16/22, 9:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: Data processing can differentiate between images
9/16/22, 9:37 PM - Aditya Vardhan: So they are not differen in conclusion
9/16/22, 9:37 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Ok
9/16/22, 9:37 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Let's see
9/16/22, 9:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
9/16/22, 9:37 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Basically
9/16/22, 9:37 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Coding>AI
9/16/22, 9:37 PM - Aditya Vardhan: So i roast a coding program
9/16/22, 9:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: At what point does data processing turn into AI?

When it self learns

But a lot of data processing already self learns as the inputs required are absolutely huge

AI is formed by data processing and combinations of other ideas
9/16/22, 9:37 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Which is ai
9/16/22, 9:37 PM - Aditya Vardhan: So i am talking about ai
9/16/22, 9:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: Like AI is a subfield of coding
9/16/22, 9:38 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Yes

Should I trust the workbook answers?
9/17/22, 9:41 AM - Aditya Vardhan: <Media omitted>
9/17/22, 9:42 AM - Aditya Vardhan: No man
Soo many of the answers are wrong in the workbook

9/17/22, 11:07 AM - Ryan: What is the highest common factor of 224 and 335
9/17/22, 11:08 AM - Ryan: <Media omitted>
9/17/22, 11:09 AM - Ryan: According to the book, it's option c
9/17/22, 11:11 AM - Ryan: I can't find the answer on my own
9/17/22, 11:13 AM - Anant Tiwari: that's correct
9/17/22, 11:13 AM - Ryan: What is the method
9/17/22, 11:13 AM - Anant Tiwari: Why? Write it in an equation
9/17/22, 11:13 AM - Ryan: I end up at 224/335

Wrong I am
9/17/22, 11:14 AM - Anant Tiwari: x * y = -16/35
x (one of the numbers) given to be -15/14
y = (-16/35) / (-15/14)
y = (-16/35) * (-14/15)
9/17/22, 11:14 AM - Anant Tiwari: and then simplify rhs, done, solved for y ie the other number
9/17/22, 11:15 AM - Ryan: What is the highest common factor of 224 and 335
9/17/22, 11:15 AM - Anant Tiwari: I don't know
9/17/22, 11:15 AM - Anant Tiwari: You can solve for it
9/17/22, 11:16 AM - Ryan: (-16/35)*(-14/15)= 224/335 right?
9/17/22, 11:16 AM - Ryan: ?
9/17/22, 11:16 AM - Anant Tiwari: No
9/17/22, 11:16 AM - Ryan: Then what is it
9/17/22, 11:16 AM - Anant Tiwari: The denominator multiplication is incorrect
9/17/22, 11:17 AM - Ryan: Oh wait the denominator
9/17/22, 11:17 AM - Ryan: Yes
9/17/22, 11:19 AM - Anant Tiwari: <Media omitted>
9/17/22, 11:19 AM - Anant Tiwari: so it's option c
9/17/22, 11:20 AM - Ryan: Nice
9/17/22, 11:21 AM - Ryan: Failing in maths
9/17/22, 11:22 AM - Anant Tiwari: Ban kardunga

9/17/22, 11:38 AM - Anant Tiwari: wait
9/17/22, 11:38 AM - Anant Tiwari: so lemme try
9/17/22, 11:38 AM - Anant Tiwari: hmmm so it may also be option b
9/17/22, 11:39 AM - Ryan: Ok
9/17/22, 11:49 AM - Amritansh 2: Uno reverese
9/17/22, 11:49 AM - Amritansh 2: It is
9/17/22, 11:50 AM - Amritansh 2: NO
9/17/22, 11:50 AM - Amritansh 2: IT IS OPTION B
9/17/22, 11:50 AM - Amritansh 2: AaAAAAA
9/17/22, 11:50 AM - Ryan: Option c too isn't it
9/17/22, 11:52 AM - Anant Tiwari: Its both
9/17/22, 11:53 AM - Amritansh 2: Heq?
9/17/22, 11:53 AM - Anant Tiwari: As always, workbook is stupid
9/17/22, 11:53 AM - Amritansh 2: How?
9/17/22, 11:53 AM - Amritansh 2: It was always stupid
9/17/22, 11:53 AM - Anant Tiwari: Can you simply -9 / 16 further
9/17/22, 11:53 AM - Ryan: Wait...it isn't workbook
9/17/22, 11:53 AM - Anant Tiwari: whatever lol
9/17/22, 11:53 AM - Anant Tiwari: you cannot
9/17/22, 11:53 AM - Amritansh 2: pH yes
9/17/22, 11:53 AM - Anant Tiwari: so its also option c
9/17/22, 11:53 AM - Anant Tiwari: both of them correct
9/17/22, 11:53 AM - Amritansh 2: I didnt read question
9/17/22, 11:53 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: standard form means

reduced form right?

like it cannot be reduced further?
9/17/22, 11:53 AM - Amritansh 2: My bbad
9/17/22, 11:53 AM - Anant Tiwari: well it may not have been tick one answer
9/17/22, 11:53 AM - Anant Tiwari: yes exactly
9/17/22, 11:54 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: okay then it is c
9/17/22, 11:54 AM - Anant Tiwari: one extra thing- it doesn't have negative in denominator
9/17/22, 11:54 AM - Anant Tiwari: and also b
9/17/22, 11:54 AM - Amritansh 2: E
9/17/22, 11:54 AM - Amritansh 2: Yere

9/17/22, 12:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: COPEEEEEE
9/17/22, 12:10 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: who did
9/17/22, 12:10 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: dis
9/17/22, 12:12 PM - Dev: Na
9/17/22, 12:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: also guys... sorry to interrupt your video but I would like to welcome you to today's sponsor - YouTube Revanced! A free, open-source, unbanned alternative to YouTube Vanced.

YouTube Revanced works by applying patches on your phone's youtube APK itself instead of patching it on some server, then distributing said files. This puts it in a slightly less legal gray-zone as compared to Vanced, nor does it use a similar logo to YouTube which allowed Google to write a cease-or-desist letter to the Vanced developer team.

With Revanced, you can even select the patches you want! Want adblock but not sponsorblock? You can do that with Revanced, but not Vanced!

Download now on your phone!

_*WARNING*_ THE ABOVE SPONSOR SEGMENT WAS A JOKE, THERE IS _NO_ DIRECT OFFICIAL APK FOR YOUTUBE REVANCED. You have to compile the patches yourself or use the Revanced manager, which is extremely buggy as of now. You must wait for a while before the Revanced Manager is on-par with Vanced manager. Compilation also often fails on Revanced, so then the last-resort is to build it on desktop manually which is much more difficult. You _can technically_ get Revanced APKs from random mirrors but their safety is questionable and I would highly-highly-highly recommend against doing that. If you want a working Revanced APK as of now, you're probably out of luck. Even I myself am struggling to get an APK built of it.

But hopefully, sometime in the near future, I can provide you guys with Revanced so you no longer have to cope with the 5+ unskippable ads which YouTube has introduced.

9/17/22, 5:58 PM - Amritansh 2: Try*
9/17/22, 5:59 PM - Ryan: Ok
9/17/22, 6:00 PM - Amritansh 2: 2nd last step is totally wrong...
9/17/22, 6:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: It is correct
9/17/22, 6:00 PM - Amritansh 2: How did you get 44+7/65???!?
9/17/22, 6:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: What did he do wrong?
9/17/22, 6:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: He took LCM in same step
9/17/22, 6:00 PM - Ryan: 46?
9/17/22, 6:00 PM - Amritansh 2: Oh wait
9/17/22, 6:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: 13 * 15 = big number in denominator

then lcm

then reduce
9/17/22, 6:00 PM - Amritansh 2: <Media omitted>
9/17/22, 6:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: hr did it directly
9/17/22, 6:00 PM - Amritansh 2: Ye
9/17/22, 6:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: the answer is correct
9/17/22, 6:00 PM - Amritansh 2: I got it
9/17/22, 6:01 PM - Amritansh 2: He had to mention the lcm
9/17/22, 6:01 PM - Amritansh 2: Or ma'am would deduct marks üßøüßø
9/17/22, 6:01 PM - Ryan: Sad
9/17/22, 6:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes add one extra step for LCM ig
9/17/22, 6:01 PM - Amritansh 2: No ig, it is mandatory
9/17/22, 6:01 PM - Amritansh 2: Not sad
9/17/22, 6:02 PM - Amritansh 2: Learning moment
9/17/22, 6:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: But as always - why

why do we need to

just because teacher said so
9/17/22, 6:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: its not like it helps much
9/17/22, 6:02 PM - Amritansh 2: It helps in clarification
9/17/22, 6:02 PM - Amritansh 2: Like
9/17/22, 6:02 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: wdym
9/17/22, 6:02 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: mention the lcm?
9/17/22, 6:02 PM - Amritansh 2: Not for beginners
9/17/22, 6:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: the point is to understand how operations on these numbers work

but in reality you'll use calculator
9/17/22, 6:02 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: like write the lcm?
9/17/22, 6:02 PM - Amritansh 2: Yes
9/17/22, 6:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: No like, taking the LCM

He didd that in same step as the addition step

So bit confusing
9/17/22, 6:02 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ü§®
9/17/22, 6:02 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ahhh

Help me
9/17/22, 6:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: You named it that
9/17/22, 6:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
9/17/22, 6:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: No to first point
9/17/22, 6:36 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: No
9/17/22, 6:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ok to second

9/17/22, 6:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
9/17/22, 6:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: So do 89+(1/4) / 4+(1/2)
9/17/22, 6:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ie (357/4) / (9/2)
= (357/4) * (2/9) = 714/36
9/17/22, 6:38 PM - Ryan: I don't even know how to do that
9/17/22, 6:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: Well see
9/17/22, 6:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: First it's a mixed fraction
9/17/22, 6:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: We convert to improper
9/17/22, 6:39 PM - Ryan: Ok
9/17/22, 6:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: The 89 is technically 89/1

So the mixed fraction 89 + (1/4) is just 356 / 4 + 1 / 5

Do same with the other fraction

4 = 8/2
8/2 + 1/2 = 9/2
9/17/22, 6:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: So (357 / 4) / (9 / 2)

To do division between two numbers is same as multiplying with reciprocal, and multiplication is easy

357 * 2 / 9 * 4
9/17/22, 6:41 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
9/17/22, 6:41 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: Procesando maroma
9/17/22, 6:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: = 714 / 36

Then find HCF of the num and denom to find standard form version
9/17/22, 6:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: Did it work now?
9/17/22, 6:42 PM - Ryan: Is the answer ‚Çπ19 5/6?
9/17/22, 6:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: Probably
9/17/22, 6:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
9/17/22, 6:43 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: nein unitary for this?
9/17/22, 6:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: You use unitary
9/17/22, 6:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
9/17/22, 6:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: That's what I did
9/17/22, 6:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: just divide to find cost of 1 whatever I didn't read the ques properly
9/17/22, 6:44 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yes
9/17/22, 6:44 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: unitary!

9/18/22, 6:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: darahs
9/18/22, 6:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: kya hua?
9/18/22, 6:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: I didn't unde
9/18/22, 6:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: rstand
9/18/22, 6:34 PM - Ryan: The question is if she can make a handkerchief of side 15cm from a square piece of cloth of 125cm¬≤

Isn't it obvious? Or is it?
9/18/22, 6:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: She can't
9/18/22, 6:35 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: No
9/18/22, 6:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: She you have to tell the length of cloth which can be made
9/18/22, 6:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: And estimating square root may help

For quick calculations

Ig the point they're making is that an easy calculation like that can be done by estimation
9/18/22, 6:36 PM - Aditya Vardhan: https://youtube.com/shorts/4QnnV4K_JmY?feature=share
9/18/22, 6:36 PM - Aditya Vardhan: 1st one
9/18/22, 6:36 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Literally
9/18/22, 6:36 PM - Aditya Vardhan: What
9/18/22, 6:36 PM - Aditya Vardhan: üòÇ
9/18/22, 6:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: dhhfhfhfhfjjfjf
9/18/22, 6:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: mam aditya is crying
9/18/22, 6:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: tears are. coming out of his eyes
9/18/22, 6:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: but he is smiling
9/18/22, 6:38 PM - Ryan: Why

Doesn't the piece of cloth has more area than the 15¬≤cm cloth
9/18/22, 6:38 PM - Ryan: Couldn't she just cut a part of the large cloth
9/18/22, 6:39 PM - Ryan: I don't know I am probably wrong
9/18/22, 6:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: It has less
9/18/22, 6:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: 15¬≤ = 225m¬≤
9/18/22, 6:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: her cloth is 125m¬≤
9/18/22, 6:40 PM - Ryan: Bruh I thought it was 125√ó125

I am stupid
9/18/22, 6:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: ah lol it's OK
9/18/22, 6:41 PM - Ryan: The maximum is 11cm Right?
9/18/22, 6:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ypu can get into decimals
9/18/22, 6:41 PM - Ryan: Ok
9/18/22, 6:46 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: me when I have to provide someone with a 16875cm cloth

9/18/22, 6:47 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: innit
9/18/22, 6:47 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: what can it be used for
9/18/22, 6:47 PM - Ryan: Or is it?
9/18/22, 6:47 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: cm
9/18/22, 6:47 PM - Ryan: What is a lot?
9/18/22, 6:47 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: 30 gallons of water, chugged in one go
9/18/22, 6:48 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: kidney fail!
9/18/22, 6:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: lmao

9/18/22, 8:52 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: try using a number?
9/18/22, 8:53 PM - Ryan: 1¬≤=1¬≥

-1¬≤>-1¬≥ I think
9/18/22, 8:53 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: like m = 2 for example

so 2, 2¬≤ = 4, 2¬≥ 8

so 2,4 <8
9/18/22, 8:53 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: what hmm uh udk
9/18/22, 8:53 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: idk,
9/18/22, 8:54 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: neutral isolated gaseous form
9/18/22, 8:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
9/18/22, 8:54 PM - Ryan: Ok
9/18/22, 8:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: It's false
9/18/22, 8:54 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: atom*
9/18/22, 8:54 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: hmm
9/18/22, 8:54 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: what's with the comma
9/18/22, 8:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: what?
9/18/22, 8:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: lmao comma issue
9/18/22, 8:55 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: m and m¬≤ ke beech mein
9/18/22, 8:55 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: comma
9/18/22, 8:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
9/18/22, 8:55 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: what does that mean
9/18/22, 8:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: the m is integer, so to show separation
9/18/22, 8:56 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ahhh
9/18/22, 8:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: any integer m <yes thats it's the m now im talking about something else> m¬≤ < m¬≥?

instead of that, just use comma
9/18/22, 8:57 PM - Aditya Vardhan: They wrote m not -m
So i donno
9/18/22, 8:57 PM - Aditya Vardhan: If m is any integer
9/18/22, 8:57 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Then false
9/18/22, 8:58 PM - Aditya Vardhan: If positive
9/18/22, 8:58 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Then truy
9/18/22, 8:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: They said integer only
9/18/22, 8:58 PM - Ryan: Are you sure about that
9/18/22, 8:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: Its still false
9/18/22, 8:59 PM - Aditya Vardhan: No
9/18/22, 8:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: 1 is positive
9/18/22, 8:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: 1¬≤ = 1¬≥ ie m¬≤ !< m¬≥ m in positive integers
9/18/22, 8:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: so
9/18/22, 8:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: joe mother
9/18/22, 8:59 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
9/18/22, 9:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: JUAN
9/18/22, 9:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: POSITIVE
9/18/22, 9:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: ELECTROSTATIC FORCE
9/18/22, 9:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: NAME THE DOS FORCES ACTING ON JUAN
9/18/22, 9:00 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Btw
9/18/22, 9:00 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Can powers be in decimal
9/18/22, 9:00 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: how to prove someone wrong

1. Assert Dominance by using big brain
2. "joe mother"
9/18/22, 9:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: FORCE JUAN - GRAVITATIONAL FORCE
FORCE DOS - ELECTROSTATIC FORCE (JUAN IS POSITIVE)
9/18/22, 9:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
9/18/22, 9:00 PM - Aditya Vardhan: So like
9/18/22, 9:00 PM - Aditya Vardhan: If in decimal
9/18/22, 9:00 PM - Aditya Vardhan: It can lower value
9/18/22, 9:00 PM - Aditya Vardhan: So
9/18/22, 9:01 PM - Aditya Vardhan: It's false
9/18/22, 9:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: You have to convert the decimal into fraction
9/18/22, 9:01 PM - Aditya Vardhan: But like
9/18/22, 9:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: 9^(0.5) = 9^(1/2) is same thing as square root
9/18/22, 9:01 PM - Aditya Vardhan: How
9/18/22, 9:01 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: 1/2 = 0.5 üòÉ
9/18/22, 9:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: ‚úÖ
9/18/22, 9:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: So 9^0.5 = 3
9/18/22, 9:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: Denominator gives you what n'th-root to take and numerator tells you to power the n'th-root result by numerator
9/18/22, 9:02 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ts
9/18/22, 9:03 PM - Aditya Vardhan: <Media omitted>
9/18/22, 9:03 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: LOL
9/18/22, 9:03 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Yes so it lowerd the value
9/18/22, 9:03 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
9/18/22, 9:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: <Media omitted>
9/18/22, 9:03 PM - Aditya Vardhan: So statement proved wrong
9/18/22, 9:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes but not always
9/18/22, 9:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: What
9/18/22, 9:03 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: bhai seizure horaha hai kya likha hai
9/18/22, 9:03 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Are the pic Ryan sent
9/18/22, 9:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: Decimals are not integers
9/18/22, 9:04 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Yes
9/18/22, 9:04 PM - Aditya Vardhan: But
9/18/22, 9:04 PM - Aditya Vardhan: It can be
9/18/22, 9:04 PM - Aditya Vardhan: I mean
9/18/22, 9:04 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
9/18/22, 9:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: so you're saying

IF m is positive decimal
9/18/22, 9:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: then the statement is false?
9/18/22, 9:04 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Ehat
9/18/22, 9:04 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
9/18/22, 9:04 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: Ehat
9/18/22, 9:04 PM - Aditya Vardhan: W
9/18/22, 9:04 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: Wehat

9/18/22, 9:05 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Ko Hindi me kya bolte he
9/18/22, 9:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: then that is correct, statement would be false

9^1/2 > 9^1/3
9/18/22, 9:05 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: gay hu
9/18/22, 9:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ok
9/18/22, 9:05 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Space bar usage?
9/18/22, 9:05 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: gayhu

9/18/22, 10:21 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: of anant topping in maths exam
9/18/22, 10:21 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: 1/2

topping and not topping
9/18/22, 10:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
9/18/22, 10:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: That's wrong
9/18/22, 10:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: The book said that the formula works if all the outcomes have an equal chance of happening

9/18/22, 10:23 PM - Aditya Vardhan: That comes under science
9/18/22, 10:23 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: haa so

you may fail and you may pass right?
9/18/22, 10:24 PM - Aditya Vardhan: There is a chance that coin might fall on it side
9/18/22, 10:24 PM - Aditya Vardhan: It depends on student
9/18/22, 10:24 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Students brain
9/18/22, 10:24 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: there is a chance that the coin may start breakdancing

9/18/22, 10:24 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yes
9/18/22, 10:24 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: you are idoot
9/18/22, 10:24 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: This message was deleted
9/18/22, 10:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: there is a higher chance of you passing if you study more
9/18/22, 10:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: so passing and failing are not equally likely
9/18/22, 10:29 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: is that like a threat or
9/18/22, 10:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: hence the formula does not work
9/18/22, 10:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: it is
9/18/22, 10:30 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Hello
9/18/22, 10:30 PM - Aditya Vardhan: I am saying
9/18/22, 10:30 PM - Aditya Vardhan: That
9/18/22, 10:30 PM - Aditya Vardhan: According to math
9/18/22, 10:30 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
9/18/22, 10:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
9/18/22, 10:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: Hi Ryan
9/18/22, 10:30 PM - Aditya Vardhan: It's a 1/80 chance
9/18/22, 10:30 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Qnd
9/18/22, 10:30 PM - Aditya Vardhan: According to science
9/18/22, 10:30 PM - Ryan: Are you sure

Can we actually use probability here

For us to use probability, the chance of each outcome should be equal

Right?

Is it equal right here?

I don't think so
9/18/22, 10:30 PM - Aditya Vardhan: It can differ
9/18/22, 10:30 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: it's wrong
9/18/22, 10:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: EXACTLY
9/18/22, 10:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: so you've studied more
9/18/22, 10:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: ie chances of you passing are higher

i can't use a formula to say exactly how high the chances of you passing are due to the outcomes not being equally likely, but i can say by calculaty-guessing that they are much higher than normal
9/18/22, 10:32 PM - Ryan: Ok
9/18/22, 10:35 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Net force

This rocket absolutely infuriates the fuck out of me, for many many reasons which I'll cover in this essay.

1) Color Scheme: Look at real life rockets. Do any of them have a blue contrast colour? NO! This is infuriating. Rockets are supposed to be white or black, not weird colours.

2) Giant Window: The window is unnecessarily large. With the power of lenses, we could've let the astronauts get a view with far smaller windows. Also, the external frame around the window is stupid and unaerodynamic, and causes a shift in the center of mass.

3) Body Shape: The shape just looks unaerodynamic. And ugly, the curve is very annoying. Rockets should ideally be sticks with stick boosters, not so disproportionately fat.

4) Nose Cone: The nose cone is almost a flat surface. There's no way that's good to prevent heating from air compression. And it just hurts the aerodynamics even more.

4) Fins: The fins don't seem to have any form of actuators, and considering the engine type which I'll come to later, the rocket likely has no way to gimbal, which is even more of an issue considering how off-centered, and unaerodynamic it is.

5) The... Engine: THIS PART ACTUALLY INFURIATES ME. THERE IS LITERALLY NO DE LAVAL NOZZLE. OR A NOZZLE FOR THAT MATTER. THIS RESULTS IN A VERY HORRIBLE SPECIFIC IMPULSE. ASSUMING THESE COMPONENTS WERE INSIDE THE BODY OF THE ROCKET, THERE WOULD BE ALMOST NO SPACE FOR FUEL, JUDGING BY THE SIZE OF THE EXHAUST PLUME. EITHERWAYS, IT'S VERY SHORT AND PROBABLY UNDER EXPANDED. AND FINALLY, THE EXHAUST IS A PLAIN YELLOW. THIS MEANS IT LIKELY USES A VERY CRINGE FUEL, LIKE LP-1 INSTEAD OF HYPERGOLS WHOSE EXHAUST PLUMES LOOK SO MUCH COOLER.

The whole time I was wondering 0.9 ka square root kya hoga and 1.6 ka square root kya hoga

I didn't realize that I could have just multiplied the numbers and find the square root of the product

9/19/22, 1:45 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Hello
9/19/22, 1:45 PM - Aditya Vardhan: <Media omitted>
9/19/22, 1:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: Bro
9/19/22, 1:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: sqrt(0.9) √ó sqrt(1.6)
sqrt9/sqrt10 √ó sqrt16/sqrt10

So take sqrt of numerators

3/root(10) √ó 4/root(10)

Now, we know that if you multiply a square root of a number by itself, you get the original number (like, sqrt(2)^2 is just 2)

So sqrt10 * sqrt10 = 10

4 * 3 / 10
12 / 10
6 / 5

9/19/22, 10:31 PM - You changed the group description
9/19/22, 11:06 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 why are black people black?

Why are white people white?

Why are our skin colours different but same at the same time?

Why not blue,why not pink, why not red?

Because of Pigments?

(If yes)Why do we have those pigments?

Did exposure to a lot of sunlight cause the men living in the African continent and other areas to develop black skin as a protection against the Sunlight

Then why is the skin of some(many) people white?
9/19/22, 11:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: ig because not everyone needs protection against sunlight
9/19/22, 11:07 PM - Ryan: Why can't I be purple naturally?

Or can I?

I don't know
9/19/22, 11:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: people who live northern up
9/19/22, 11:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: you can
9/19/22, 11:08 PM - Ryan: No dyes or paints allowed?

That is cheating
9/19/22, 11:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: why do we have those pigments well
9/19/22, 11:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: they help us exist in this case
9/19/22, 11:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: less skin cancer = higher chance of reproducing
9/19/22, 11:08 PM - Ryan: How
9/19/22, 11:08 PM - Ryan: Oh
9/19/22, 11:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: = higher chance the traits get passed down

the baby also have said pigeons üòÉü¶Üüê¶
9/19/22, 11:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: üê∑ments
9/19/22, 11:09 PM - Ryan: Pigeons
9/19/22, 11:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: why it cant be blue or red or whatever welllllllll
9/19/22, 11:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: im not sure

maybe not as effective at protecting against sunlight? maybe the color is too hard to produce using natural substances?
9/19/22, 11:09 PM - Ryan: Ok
9/19/22, 11:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: no like
9/19/22, 11:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: the pigments

more weird color, more complicated chemistry which is not nice as universe wants things to be simple, so less likely it is
9/19/22, 11:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: but i don't know ans of rest
9/19/22, 11:10 PM - Ryan: In a certain environment and with a certain diet and genes

Can I be purple from birth?
9/19/22, 11:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: probably
9/19/22, 11:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: but certain genes
9/19/22, 11:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: those are gonna be hard to get
9/19/22, 11:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: i mean if you want to do it ethically
9/19/22, 11:11 PM - Ryan: Hmm?
9/19/22, 11:11 PM - Ryan: What are the ethical and unethical methods
9/19/22, 11:12 PM - Anant Tiwari: ethical - do shit to force people to make it so dababy more likely to purple, very certain conditions and thousands of generations required

unethical - modify gene!
9/19/22, 11:12 PM - Ryan: Unethical is modify gene?
9/19/22, 11:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: well for some reason it is considered unethical
9/19/22, 11:14 PM - Ryan: Through what ways I can modify genes?

Radiation?
Selective breeding?(I am not sure with this)
9/19/22, 11:15 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: I SAW VIDEO
9/19/22, 11:15 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: LITERALLY RN
9/19/22, 11:15 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ABOUT GENES MODIFICATION
9/19/22, 11:15 PM - Ryan: CRISPR?

9/19/22, 11:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
9/19/22, 11:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: nukes were used to modify crips
9/19/22, 11:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: crops
9/19/22, 11:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: useful mutations would be picked to grow
9/19/22, 11:16 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: hmmm
9/19/22, 11:16 PM - Ryan: I kind of don't understand CRISPR yet?

What is CRISPR?
9/19/22, 11:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: selective breeding exists already, has been done for millenia
9/19/22, 11:16 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: crispy chips
9/19/22, 11:16 PM - Ryan: Selectively breeding humans or other races I unethical right?
9/19/22, 11:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: in DNA, you like shoot shit at certain parts in hopes it disables those segments or something
9/19/22, 11:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: Well...
9/19/22, 11:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: Welcome to the United States of America, United Kingdom, India, China, Arab, Africa, Europe, Insert every other major region in the world
9/19/22, 11:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: A lot of selective breeding has been done
9/19/22, 11:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: On humans
9/19/22, 11:17 PM - Ryan: What?
9/19/22, 11:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: It's not a nice part of history
9/19/22, 11:18 PM - Ryan: Why?
9/19/22, 11:18 PM - Ryan: During slavery?

When?
9/19/22, 11:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: same reason its done for any other animal
9/19/22, 11:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: in USA  in 1840s
9/19/22, 11:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: pretty common
9/19/22, 11:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: a lot of other countries before that too
9/19/22, 11:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: i would not like to elaborate further
9/19/22, 11:19 PM - Ryan: That is traumatizing

But science?

Or is it?
9/19/22, 11:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: not for science
9/19/22, 11:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: for benefit of slave owners
9/19/22, 11:19 PM - Ryan: In terms of science, ignoring morals and ethics is ok
9/19/22, 11:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: üëç
9/19/22, 11:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: which is why i am about to chlorinate you
9/19/22, 11:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: FOR SCIENCE
9/19/22, 11:19 PM - Ryan: Yes to get the best quality slave(that is not the right set of words to use)
9/19/22, 11:20 PM - Ryan: Unfortunately

History is not pleasant

Neither is present
9/19/22, 11:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: [9/19, 11:16 PM] Ryan: Selectively breeding humans or other races I unethical right?
[9/19, 11:18 PM] Ryan: That is traumatizing

But science?

Or is it?
[9/19, 11:19 PM] Ryan: In terms of science, ignoring morals and ethics is ok
[9/19, 11:19 PM] Ryan: Yes to get the best quality slave(that is not the right set of words to use)
9/19/22, 11:20 PM - Navya: h
9/19/22, 11:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes

9/19/22, 11:20 PM - Navya: ibihibibibibi
9/19/22, 11:22 PM - Ryan: Science has ignored morals many times

Many science experiments are conducted on animals like beagles,Rats etc

Next are humans probably
9/19/22, 11:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: Next?
9/19/22, 11:23 PM - Ryan: One day will come

When it will be a necessity
9/19/22, 11:23 PM - You added Parth
9/19/22, 11:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
9/19/22, 11:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: Honestly I'm down for unethical experiments on humans like those on death row or concentration camps
9/19/22, 11:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: Wait, that already happens
9/19/22, 11:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: So
9/19/22, 11:24 PM - Parth: Uuh
9/19/22, 11:24 PM - Ryan: Each human has some potential as an experiment
9/19/22, 11:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: Welcome to swag group
9/19/22, 11:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: Including you
9/19/22, 11:24 PM - Dev: @917838968821 @919717944490  will it be possible to create electricity by not using clear water but instead by using like
9/19/22, 11:24 PM - Ryan: Yes
9/19/22, 11:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: What?
9/19/22, 11:24 PM - Navya: yes I think
9/19/22, 11:24 PM - Navya: u can use water n salt
9/19/22, 11:24 PM - Dev: How?
9/19/22, 11:25 PM - Navya: it will create electricity
9/19/22, 11:25 PM - Navya: and then battery interaction
9/19/22, 11:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ummm...
9/19/22, 11:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: What
9/19/22, 11:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: It would be a conductor
9/19/22, 11:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: but electricity

how üòÉ
9/19/22, 11:25 PM - Dev: Like it about the pressure or the water
9/19/22, 11:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: what
9/19/22, 11:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: pressure or??
9/19/22, 11:25 PM - Dev: That spins the turbine and creates electricity
9/19/22, 11:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: uh
9/19/22, 11:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: hydropower
9/19/22, 11:25 PM - Dev: It's like how fast it spins it
9/19/22, 11:26 PM - Dev: I can be completely wrong
9/19/22, 11:26 PM - Dev: I am smol brain
9/19/22, 11:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: faster water move
9/19/22, 11:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: faster turbine spin
9/19/22, 11:26 PM - Dev: Yes
9/19/22, 11:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: depends on mass flow rate
9/19/22, 11:26 PM - Ryan: Literally

Many human specimens is better than animal specimens

We can get more accurate results

Faster breakthroughs and discoveries

The problem is the denial

Why me? Why was I the one experimented on? Aren't we all equal?

By experimenting on humans, we may break the right to equality of humans

So we can do it, but not legally I think
9/19/22, 11:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: so more electricity

thats just hydropower, has existed for 140+ years
9/19/22, 11:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: You can volunteer
9/19/22, 11:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: People volunteer
9/19/22, 11:26 PM - Dev: So like the water in the swedes be used to do it
9/19/22, 11:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: swedes?
9/19/22, 11:27 PM - Dev: It will save natural wate rby a bit
9/19/22, 11:27 PM - Navya: U can create electricity with water only
9/19/22, 11:27 PM - Dev: Sewer*
9/19/22, 11:27 PM - Dev: It's it Kostya created in dams
9/19/22, 11:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: the sewer water does not move fast
9/19/22, 11:27 PM - Ryan: I would rather be the one who experiments
9/19/22, 11:27 PM - Navya: ok
9/19/22, 11:27 PM - Parth: Why are you obsessed with torture of human
9/19/22, 11:27 PM - Parth: S
9/19/22, 11:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: the machines would get harmed more due to unclean water, and it won't generate that much electric yt
9/19/22, 11:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: electricity
9/19/22, 11:27 PM - Ryan: This is not a choice

We will be forced

The weakest will be chosen
9/19/22, 11:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: Exactly
9/19/22, 11:27 PM - Dev: Because the water flows down at a large pressure by like flowing down the dam
9/19/22, 11:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: They are already being chosen
9/19/22, 11:27 PM - Dev: I think
9/19/22, 11:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes but it's not worth it for sewage water
9/19/22, 11:28 PM - Dev: So will electricity be used to pump that water up and then
9/19/22, 11:28 PM - Dev: Bring it down with pressure
9/19/22, 11:28 PM - Dev: I think
9/19/22, 11:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: ??????
9/19/22, 11:28 PM - Ryan: What if we were superior
9/19/22, 11:28 PM - Dev: Like the sewage water
9/19/22, 11:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: well
9/19/22, 11:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: then you are the one who experiments
9/19/22, 11:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: wahi to kaha
9/19/22, 11:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: .
9/19/22, 11:29 PM - Dev: Ah
9/19/22, 11:29 PM - Dev: Can that water be cleaned
9/19/22, 11:29 PM - Dev: But more resources
9/19/22, 11:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ya
9/19/22, 11:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: But difficult
9/19/22, 11:29 PM - Ryan: Can we

Through experiments, selective breeding, monitored growth and technology

Can we make a superior human race
9/19/22, 11:29 PM - Dev: So I think we should be using normal water
9/19/22, 11:29 PM - Dev: From dams
9/19/22, 11:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: We already do
9/19/22, 11:29 PM - Ryan: Which will outshine the homosapiens
9/19/22, 11:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: yea i mean
9/19/22, 11:29 PM - Dev: Can human be fused with monkey dna
9/19/22, 11:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: we're very different from homo sapiens 20,000 years ago, much more than normal evolution
9/19/22, 11:29 PM - Dev: To become monkey
9/19/22, 11:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: thanks to technology
9/19/22, 11:30 PM - Ryan: Physically stronger, smarter

Not limited to 4 limbs

Not limited to a single body
9/19/22, 11:30 PM - Ryan: A machine
9/19/22, 11:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yea sentient AI
9/19/22, 11:30 PM - Ryan: Machine with strong AI
9/19/22, 11:30 PM - Dev: It possible?
9/19/22, 11:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: i don't know these exact classifications sorry
9/19/22, 11:30 PM - Dev: I think
9/19/22, 11:30 PM - Dev: But difficult
9/19/22, 11:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: But i mean

robots are prett strong

cant think tho, yet
9/19/22, 11:30 PM - Dev: Robots are strong
9/19/22, 11:30 PM - Ryan: What is thinking?
9/19/22, 11:30 PM - Ryan: I don't know
9/19/22, 11:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: yea that's the thing
9/19/22, 11:30 PM - Dev: I think they can be made strong
9/19/22, 11:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: no one knows
9/19/22, 11:31 PM - Ryan: It is a pretty complex phenomenon for me
9/19/22, 11:31 PM - Dev: I did not know they were already strong
9/19/22, 11:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: literally we don't know how the brain works
9/19/22, 11:31 PM - Dev: üòÉ
9/19/22, 11:31 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: human mutation monke
9/19/22, 11:31 PM - Dev: Human cringe
Monkey nice
9/19/22, 11:31 PM - Parth: Yeah
9/19/22, 11:31 PM - Ryan: Is it just a pattern of neural activity in the brain?

How do we visualize images in our brains, how do we remember songs ?

How?
9/19/22, 11:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: to create an AI which is similar to the human mind:

there are various approaches

you could graph every single parth of every single component of brain, but that requires extremely high resolution scanning of weird components, and is difficult to do
9/19/22, 11:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: but that's not happening any time soom
9/19/22, 11:32 PM - Dev: Do you know we don't still don't know ehy headaches happen
9/19/22, 11:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: so we find the components which are absolutely necessary and try to emulate them with easier tech
9/19/22, 11:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: depends on the type of headache
9/19/22, 11:32 PM - Parth: And DEATH is one of the most mystical thing like why do our cell or organs just dicied to not work or die?
9/19/22, 11:32 PM - Dev: Creating an AI is very difficult
9/19/22, 11:32 PM - Dev: Very rare
9/19/22, 11:32 PM - Dev: But can happen
9/19/22, 11:32 PM - Dev: In organs
9/19/22, 11:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: pattern of neural activity yes, certain neurons going through certain pathways, hormones moving around, kind of work towards it
9/19/22, 11:32 PM - Dev: In cells I don't know
9/19/22, 11:32 PM - Parth: It happens
9/19/22, 11:32 PM - Parth: To many people
9/19/22, 11:32 PM - Dev: Animal facts-
9/19/22, 11:33 PM - Parth: "" death by age"
9/19/22, 11:33 PM - Ryan: Yes
9/19/22, 11:33 PM - Dev: Cheetahs can not roar
9/19/22, 11:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: Because living is hard

When you do it for a long time
9/19/22, 11:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: You make mistake
9/19/22, 11:33 PM - Dev: They growl and meow
9/19/22, 11:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: The mistake hurt you
9/19/22, 11:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: You die
9/19/22, 11:33 PM - Parth: Like bro why all of a sudden?
9/19/22, 11:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: Same with cells
9/19/22, 11:33 PM - Dev: Too much work for them I suppose
9/19/22, 11:33 PM - Parth: No i am not talking about dease
9/19/22, 11:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: Problems slowly manifesting and then one kills. "death by age" still has an underlying reason
9/19/22, 11:33 PM - Parth: Or anything
9/19/22, 11:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: ik
9/19/22, 11:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: but like
9/19/22, 11:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: for example people who die in sleep
9/19/22, 11:34 PM - Parth: I am talking about like tf does " death by age " actually mean
9/19/22, 11:34 PM - Ryan: What are the requirements of life

Nutrition, respiration, Excretion?

Or is it?
9/19/22, 11:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: some organ stopped working

no one bothered to look into the body of the dead person to figure out exactly what happened
9/19/22, 11:34 PM - Dev: I think many people die in sleep
9/19/22, 11:34 PM - Dev: Or is it?

Hm it is necessary but no one has tried not to do this things
9/19/22, 11:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: death by age is meaningless. large complex animals don't die by age, they die because something fails.

every person who dies by age, still dies from an underlying reason. organs failing suddenly. but no one bothers to do detail examination of exactly why they died
9/19/22, 11:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: so they just write "death by old age"
9/19/22, 11:35 PM - Dev: Elephant can't jump
9/19/22, 11:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: and it's hard to figure out

multiple things may be killing the person at the same time

one does it a bit too fast

trying to investigate may not always lead to correct reason
9/19/22, 11:35 PM - Parth: Yeah they are fat
9/19/22, 11:35 PM - Dev: No
9/19/22, 11:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: Define jumping
9/19/22, 11:36 PM - Parth: So i gues we'll never know
9/19/22, 11:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ya
9/19/22, 11:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: We can if we want to
9/19/22, 11:36 PM - Ryan: Atleast in our current bodies

I think we can live longer with better bodies

Made up of plastics, metals I don't know

Can we just give the human brain a mechanical body

Probably no?

Or yes?
9/19/22, 11:36 PM - Dev: Physical going into the Arizona by your legs
9/19/22, 11:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: But people don't bother
9/19/22, 11:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: religious reasons too
9/19/22, 11:36 PM - Dev: Going into the air*
9/19/22, 11:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: Like looking into death may be seen as bad practice. so they don't. and just say death by old age
9/19/22, 11:36 PM - Dev: Can new cells be made?
9/19/22, 11:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: for now, no
9/19/22, 11:36 PM - Dev: Like outside of the body
9/19/22, 11:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: Uh...
9/19/22, 11:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
9/19/22, 11:36 PM - Parth: No i dont its the skin which causes death
9/19/22, 11:37 PM - Dev: Can be in some cases
9/19/22, 11:37 PM - Ryan: ??
9/19/22, 11:37 PM - Parth: Liek it sometimes
9/19/22, 11:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: in labs? from scratch?
9/19/22, 11:37 PM - Parth: To some people
9/19/22, 11:37 PM - Dev: I mean a but of equipment
9/19/22, 11:37 PM - Dev: Like requriments
9/19/22, 11:37 PM - Dev: Strongest cat is a triger
9/19/22, 11:37 PM - Dev: Lions are overhyped
9/19/22, 11:38 PM - Dev: Everyone say that who will win in a fight against a tiger and a lion
9/19/22, 11:38 PM - Dev: But like how would it happen
9/19/22, 11:38 PM - Parth: Indeed bur they the king after all they got the mindset
9/19/22, 11:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: We have created what one would consider "living"

But not in the same way nature did it, not using the same molecules, not following the same structures and processes
9/19/22, 11:38 PM - Dev: They love on so different conditions
9/19/22, 11:38 PM - Parth: Cobra mindset
9/19/22, 11:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: ?
9/19/22, 11:38 PM - Parth: Andew tateüî•üî•
9/19/22, 11:38 PM - Parth: Liions
9/19/22, 11:38 PM - Dev: In india there are both lions and tiger but like them fighting is nearly impossible
9/19/22, 11:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: bad person he is
9/19/22, 11:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
9/19/22, 11:38 PM - Dev: Live*
9/19/22, 11:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: gujarat vs bengal
9/19/22, 11:39 PM - Dev: Begal
9/19/22, 11:39 PM - Parth: No he my idle
9/19/22, 11:39 PM - Dev: Tiger are stronger
9/19/22, 11:39 PM - Dev: Faster
9/19/22, 11:39 PM - Dev: And smarter
9/19/22, 11:39 PM - Parth: Yeah begalli tigers
9/19/22, 11:39 PM - Parth: Are world famouse
9/19/22, 11:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: <Media omitted>
9/19/22, 11:39 PM - Dev: The biggest tiger is the sibarien tiger
9/19/22, 11:40 PM - Dev: In like hight and weight
9/19/22, 11:40 PM - Parth: Do you know andrew tate like about his life and every podcast
9/19/22, 11:40 PM - Parth: Have you seen them
9/19/22, 11:40 PM - Dev: No
9/19/22, 11:40 PM - Dev: This shit is all about fame
9/19/22, 11:40 PM - Dev: For them
9/19/22, 11:40 PM - Parth: Bruh
9/19/22, 11:40 PM - Parth: You dont know him
9/19/22, 11:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: No, but I judged by these opinions on goovle . But chalo I know less about him than you, so you are right ig
9/19/22, 11:41 PM - Dev: Hm
9/19/22, 11:41 PM - Parth: Yeah
9/19/22, 11:41 PM - Dev: There is a chance that a wormhole just spawn behind you
9/19/22, 11:41 PM - Dev: How dos ethe black hole work
9/19/22, 11:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: Chance of anything happening is more than 0
9/19/22, 11:41 PM - Dev: Is there ven a black hole
9/19/22, 11:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: ????
9/19/22, 11:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: ofcourse there is
9/19/22, 11:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: we have pictures of their accretion disk
9/19/22, 11:42 PM - Parth: He say something which has a point (super point ) but then there are some disadvantages
9/19/22, 11:42 PM - Dev: How can we say those are real
9/19/22, 11:42 PM - Dev: I mean they can be
9/19/22, 11:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: How can we say moon landing is real
9/19/22, 11:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: And im gonna be honest
9/19/22, 11:42 PM - Parth: Not his i kinda disagree here
9/19/22, 11:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: I can't say with 100% certainty
9/19/22, 11:42 PM - Dev: We can not
9/19/22, 11:42 PM - Parth: Liek about the property thing but
9/19/22, 11:43 PM - Dev: There is a chance that we might be living in a simulation
9/19/22, 11:43 PM - Dev: Who knows
9/19/22, 11:43 PM - Dev: Jelly fish are the most stupid animal
9/19/22, 11:43 PM - Dev: Like why do they exist?
9/19/22, 11:43 PM - Parth: Scientifically women has less reactions time than men thats why he siad about driving and all and that he wont make a female driver for him
9/19/22, 11:44 PM - Parth: 25
9/19/22, 11:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: But i can say with >99% certainty that it is

100,000s of people worked on Apollo

If it was fake, people would have leaked the information
Soviet union sent a spacecraft to the moon before Apollo 11 landing, and the spacecraft made observations thst they had landed and all. If they didn't land, then soviet union could expose NASA's lie. But they didn't. The science behind it is very likely correct
9/19/22, 11:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: can't be 100% sure but can be 99.99999% sure
9/19/22, 11:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ha bhai
9/19/22, 11:44 PM - Dev: Yes
9/19/22, 11:44 PM - Dev: There is always a chnace
9/19/22, 11:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: rEaCtIoN time

Like yea bro you need 0.00001ms reaction time to drive a car
9/19/22, 11:44 PM - Dev: Tha something is true
9/19/22, 11:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: üòê
9/19/22, 11:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: And something is false
9/19/22, 11:44 PM - Parth: Bruh
9/19/22, 11:45 PM - Parth: You got my point come on
9/19/22, 11:46 PM - Dev: Yes
9/19/22, 11:46 PM - Dev: Reaction time differes fir everyone
9/19/22, 11:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: yess
9/19/22, 11:46 PM - Dev: It's not always the same
9/19/22, 11:47 PM - Dev: For everyone
9/19/22, 11:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: but chalo, women should be allowed to drive, no ifs or buts, different topic now
9/19/22, 11:47 PM - Dev: Animal
9/19/22, 11:47 PM - Dev: Tell face everyone
9/19/22, 11:47 PM - Dev: About animals
9/19/22, 11:49 PM - Dev: Fact*
9/20/22, 12:11 AM - Anant Tiwari: Ryan sojao
9/20/22, 12:12 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
9/20/22, 12:12 AM - Anant Tiwari: <Media omitted>
9/20/22, 12:12 AM - Parth: Ryan pls raat ho rhi ha aise kuch mat poochena jisse sir mer bom blast ho jaeye
9/20/22, 12:12 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: hahaha

seizure hojaayega padhke
9/20/22, 12:12 AM - Parth: Ha bhi
9/20/22, 12:13 AM - Anant Tiwari: I am on high-alert for any questions posed by wild-ryans in the wilderness
9/20/22, 12:13 AM - Ryan: @917838968821 can data be extracted from electronic wastes like hard-drives

Are your deleted files truly deleted?

Your each search is tracked right?

Your each online activity

Your speech through your phone

Right?

Are you really secret

Is there any part of you that somebody doesn't know

There probably is

Or is there?


All of your data

All of your activity

It is not safe

Is it?
9/20/22, 12:13 AM - Anant Tiwari: Please stop
9/20/22, 12:13 AM - Parth: Aaaaaaaaa
9/20/22, 12:13 AM - Anant Tiwari: Okay wait this I can actually answer
9/20/22, 12:13 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: bhai ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è
9/20/22, 12:13 AM - Anant Tiwari: yes! it absolutely can
9/20/22, 12:13 AM - Anant Tiwari: shredded papers can be erased
9/20/22, 12:13 AM - Anant Tiwari: many types of drives depending on the fs don't actually erase the data upon deletion
9/20/22, 12:13 AM - Parth: Its not safe
9/20/22, 12:13 AM - Anant Tiwari: they just mark it as overwriteable
9/20/22, 12:14 AM - Ryan: With fire

Burning them

Corroding them?

Turning them into cotton candy?
9/20/22, 12:14 AM - Anant Tiwari: i meant like
9/20/22, 12:14 AM - Parth: Firw
9/20/22, 12:14 AM - Anant Tiwari: they can be converted back into form
9/20/22, 12:14 AM - Anant Tiwari: fire they should but
9/20/22, 12:14 AM - Anant Tiwari: not that safe ig
9/20/22, 12:14 AM - Anant Tiwari: if its just shredded then its easy to get it back with a lot of work
9/20/22, 12:14 AM - Anant Tiwari: your files are not truly deleted
9/20/22, 12:14 AM - Parth: Aag laga ke usko flush kardo
9/20/22, 12:15 AM - Anant Tiwari: for above mentioned reason
9/20/22, 12:15 AM - Parth: üëåüèº
9/20/22, 12:15 AM - Parth: @919717944490
9/20/22, 12:15 AM - Ryan: That is truly terrifying

Or is it?

None of us have secrets anymore do we

Somebody knows who we are

Who we truly are

That is terrifying
9/20/22, 12:15 AM - Anant Tiwari: Each search is tracked yes. The government has set up many filters for suspicious searches

Technically, your speech CAN be tracked. But there's not much point, it's harder to analyze voice activity than text activity
9/20/22, 12:16 AM - Parth: Yes
9/20/22, 12:16 AM - Anant Tiwari: But if necessary they can track you in more detail much more easily
9/20/22, 12:16 AM - Anant Tiwari: Yea I have secrets, the government as of now cannot read my mind
9/20/22, 12:16 AM - Ryan: Through this device

Through each online device right

Through our each online activity
9/20/22, 12:16 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: or
9/20/22, 12:17 AM - Anant Tiwari: If you don't want to be tracked, don't use the Internet. That is not a compromise most people want
9/20/22, 12:17 AM - Anant Tiwari: So they let their data loose for convenience
9/20/22, 12:17 AM - Ryan: Yes it can't

But can it predict?

By analyzing your behavior and personality based on the tracked information

I do not expect much accurate tracking
9/20/22, 12:17 AM - Ryan: Nice
9/20/22, 12:18 AM - Anant Tiwari: As of 2022 lie detector tests in most countries cannot be used in courts
9/20/22, 12:18 AM - Anant Tiwari: In almost all countries
9/20/22, 12:18 AM - Anant Tiwari: They can predict but very, very unlikely to be correct. too much entropy, essentially, in one's behaviour
9/20/22, 12:18 AM - Ryan: Because lie detectors aren't that accurate are they

They depend on stress and other factors right?

A nervous innocent person is not suitable for such device I think
9/20/22, 12:18 AM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
9/20/22, 12:19 AM - Anant Tiwari: Similarly tracking and guessing
9/20/22, 12:19 AM - Anant Tiwari: They suffer from same issue
9/20/22, 12:19 AM - Anant Tiwari: You know
9/20/22, 12:19 AM - Ryan: Hmm
9/20/22, 12:19 AM - Ryan: Ok
9/20/22, 12:19 AM - Anant Tiwari: I read about √ñtzi, a human who died 5,000 years ago
9/20/22, 12:19 AM - Anant Tiwari: On wikipedia
9/20/22, 12:19 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: yoo
9/20/22, 12:19 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: tell me
9/20/22, 12:19 AM - Ryan: nice
9/20/22, 12:20 AM - Anant Tiwari: thanks to him being well preserved, we know:

- what diet he had
- how old he was when he died
- how he was killed
- his probable near friend's death location
- dna tracking to find people related to him now
- how many hours he ate food, what food, before he died
- he was probably not well-groomed
9/20/22, 12:20 AM - Anant Tiwari: this is touching the surface
9/20/22, 12:20 AM - Anant Tiwari: there were many many many other things in the article
9/20/22, 12:20 AM - Anant Tiwari: about this random man
9/20/22, 12:21 AM - Anant Tiwari: thanks to a bunch of ice
9/20/22, 12:21 AM - Anant Tiwari: ofcourse this is an extreme edge case

but probably no written language was developed in that time

he would not have possibly figured that he would be this well known 5,000 years after his death
9/20/22, 12:22 AM - Anant Tiwari: what's to say we won't learn about some physics thing in the next 5,000 years which makes entropy much less mysterious? every interaction with every particle ever could be recorded if it were to happen. ofcourse based on our current understanding this is simply not possible, but also as of √∂tzi's understanding none of what we knew about him was possible either. we likely know more about that guy than he knew himself
9/20/22, 12:23 AM - Anant Tiwari: anything can happen because no one knows how the universe works, if it's dictated by special powers or not

the government may not be able to send me to prison for my secrets now, but they may torture me in heaven or hell or whatever instead
9/20/22, 12:24 AM - Anant Tiwari: microchips are even scarier. assuming you developed one, you could essentially kidnap a person, implant one and control their memories to make them forget about it. How do we know this hasn't already happened?
9/20/22, 12:25 AM - Anant Tiwari: the fear of the unknown, doesn't stem from unknowns but rather from the fact that there are unknown unknowns
9/20/22, 12:25 AM - Anant Tiwari: You are not safe.
9/20/22, 12:26 AM - Anant Tiwari: From the government, or perhaps even me.
9/20/22, 12:26 AM - Anant Tiwari: Run.
9/20/22, 12:26 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
9/20/22, 1:51 AM - Navya: this
9/20/22, 1:51 AM - Navya: makes
9/20/22, 1:51 AM - Navya: no
9/20/22, 1:51 AM - Navya: sense
9/20/22, 1:51 AM - Anant Tiwari: Laughed so funny I the
9/20/22, 2:23 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: Laughed so funny I the
9/20/22, 9:32 AM - Aditya Vardhan: who is @918178057352
9/20/22, 9:32 AM - Aditya Vardhan: Mobile reset
9/20/22, 9:32 AM - Aditya Vardhan: I don't know
9/20/22, 9:33 AM - Aditya Vardhan: I have a stack of battery
9/20/22, 11:46 AM - Parth: CYMOOD
9/20/22, 11:52 AM - Aditya Vardhan: Eminem: _roasts Michael Jackson_
Michael: buys Eminem publishing
9/20/22, 12:05 PM - Dev: Na
9/20/22, 12:15 PM - Ryan: I believe the grammar part is going to be very tough

How to effectively study grammar
9/20/22, 12:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: focus on understanding what it means that's what effectively studying is
9/20/22, 12:21 PM - Ryan: What is the meaning of tense
9/20/22, 12:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: words used to show idea of time
9/20/22, 12:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: or not necessarily words
9/20/22, 12:25 PM - Ryan: Ok
9/20/22, 12:35 PM - Ryan: Unfortunately that requires a brain and patience

I have neither of them

I am stupid
9/20/22, 12:52 PM - Ryan: Is friction more interesting or light?
9/20/22, 12:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: "interesting" define
9/20/22, 12:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: if you are interested in mechanical things then maybe friction would be more interesting

9/20/22, 7:04 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: *intense hand waving*
9/20/22, 7:04 PM - Ryan: HOTS are coming in the English exam

Which means it would require a deeper understanding of the chapters and more thinking

How do you do that
9/20/22, 7:04 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: read the chapter
9/20/22, 7:05 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: "thoroughly"
9/20/22, 7:05 PM - Ryan: I have read
9/20/22, 7:05 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: do it again
5 more times

or maybe watch a video on it?
9/20/22, 7:05 PM - Ryan: "Don't they feel homesick" I wonder

What does Ruskin Bond mean by this
9/20/22, 7:05 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: homesick do you know meaning
9/20/22, 7:06 PM - Ryan: Reading the chapter is not enough

It requires you to actually take interest
9/20/22, 7:06 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: which most students don't have
9/20/22, 7:06 PM - Ryan: Probably
9/20/22, 7:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: what do you think
9/20/22, 7:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: what does homesick mean
9/20/22, 7:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: given context of chapter, why wouldn't they feel homesick
9/20/22, 7:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: ruskin is clearly talking about how homesick he was
9/20/22, 7:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: he's comparing their experience to his
9/20/22, 7:08 PM - Ryan: Ruskin Bond has a deep connection with the country. His love for the land doesn't allow him to leave the country. He can't bare leaving India. He wonders why his fellow Indians are so eager to leave this land. Leave this diverse,beautiful land in which they were born in. Ruskin bond himself loves this land, but he doesn't why the fellow Indians long to return to back

Back to this beautiful land

According to me

I can't find more of an answer
9/20/22, 7:08 PM - Ryan: I am tired
9/20/22, 7:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: frame it during exam then
9/20/22, 7:09 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: Hi tired

Why is the brain so delicate?

9/20/22, 7:38 PM - Navya: it can make u mental
9/20/22, 7:38 PM - Ryan: According to some sources, sadness kind of reduces the amount of grey matter in your brain

I don't know if it is true
9/20/22, 7:38 PM - Ryan: How does it do that?
9/20/22, 7:39 PM - Parth: Idk
9/20/22, 7:40 PM - Parth: But depression does effect
9/20/22, 7:40 PM - Parth: Our body
9/20/22, 7:40 PM - Parth: So maybe
9/20/22, 7:42 PM - Navya: Yes
1)grey matter makes the outer most layer of the brain
2) it destroys memory
3) it's some sort of protein
4)u start forgetting everything  and your brain cells die
5)it is very delicate BCZ it is?like if u dont get urself proteins and stuffs

9/21/22, 2:10 PM - Ryan: Or am I memotiziing
9/21/22, 2:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: Depends
9/21/22, 2:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: it's your choice
9/21/22, 2:10 PM - Ryan: I think I only studied a little bit science
9/21/22, 2:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: a lot of the questions you had to figure out how to frame yourself, no?
9/21/22, 2:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: so if you did well
9/21/22, 2:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: then you actually studied and not memorized

9/21/22, 4:34 PM - Ryan: Can you actually make a smart phone with just the blue prints?
9/21/22, 4:35 PM - Ryan: If an object is compressed from all directions

Will it become a circle?
9/21/22, 4:36 PM - Ryan: Compressed with enough force?
9/21/22, 4:36 PM - Ryan: How large can an atom be?
9/21/22, 4:37 PM - Ryan: I am stupid
9/21/22, 4:43 PM - Aditya Vardhan: A1)yes it stores info
A2)No one knows
A3)not completely wrong but yeah it can get wrong sometimes if it would be exactly the same as parent we would never evolve
9/21/22, 4:43 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Many different

9/21/22, 7:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: communication is exchanging information, can be done in many ways

words generally don't have a definite meaning. one, depends on context and two a lot of them can't necessarily be written in a definition, in those cases you just kinda learn to associate it with an object to understand it's usage

biology kaha se ghusa di üò≠
9/21/22, 7:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: but I've heard that the shape makes some types of sound louder

now don't ask me how it makes it louder
9/21/22, 7:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: hexagon is a very biologically unstable shape
9/21/22, 7:12 PM - Anant Tiwari: DNA is kinda like a polymer, but the monomer are these units called c-g-a-t cytosine guanine adenine ig ? thiamine, and they "store" the information

well the helix has these pairs to both ends of the helix spiral, and c always bonds to g and the a always bonds to t
9/21/22, 7:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: but i don't know in detail how this works
9/21/22, 7:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: well it tells certain molecules "go mitosis in this way, go die in this way" which gives structure

the structure is defined by fine tuning of data of the dna thanks to ofcourse evolution
9/21/22, 7:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: if that's what you're asking
9/21/22, 7:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: well pretty damn complex. a cub with billions of transistors with an iGPU, 4-8 gigs of RAM, 32-128gigs of storage, a microphone, a speaker, wifi and bluetooth card, a touchscreen all squished into (in my case) 10√ó4√ó1 cm¬≥

much more "complexity-dense" than any mechanical machine
9/21/22, 7:17 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Yes
9/21/22, 7:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: Depends but for 99.99999999999% of the people it is not even close to possible. the amount of tooling you'd need for placing those transistors (keep in mind these are getting to the same of _10s of atoms_), make sure that nothing gets destroyed while you're doing it etc
9/21/22, 7:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: No because a circle does not exist
9/21/22, 7:17 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Human>machine
9/21/22, 7:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: Infinitely large
9/21/22, 7:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: Atoms do not have maximum radius
9/21/22, 7:17 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Yes it's just so many side that it's appears to be a circle
9/21/22, 7:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: (assuming atom radius means distance between center of nucleus and outermost atom)
9/21/22, 7:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: @919717944490 there are your answers
9/21/22, 7:19 PM - Ryan: Ok
9/21/22, 7:25 PM - Dev: Bhutta
9/21/22, 7:25 PM - Ryan: Yes but why does the adenine bind to the thymine (probably wrong spelling) and cytosine to the guanine

Why?

What is the difference between RNA and DNA apart from being single stranded and double stranded(I may be wrong)

What is the role of ribose(it is a type of sugar right?) in dna, and phosphorus and nitrogen

And other element that I may not know of
9/21/22, 7:25 PM - Dev: Corn
9/21/22, 7:25 PM - Ryan: I should be studying AI right now
9/21/22, 7:26 PM - Ryan: But biology more important
9/21/22, 7:27 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 You definitely know the answers
9/21/22, 7:35 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: Bhutta

20 ka Chutta
9/21/22, 7:42 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 How does mass affect air drag

How do much faster objects perceive time?

What is this General Relativity of Einstein? I have only heard of it
9/21/22, 7:45 PM - Ryan: What is time?

What is space?
9/21/22, 7:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: I think that's enough question time for today
9/21/22, 7:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: fine
9/21/22, 7:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: mass of air particles?
9/21/22, 7:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: well then collision between air and you will be stronger, more momentum involved
9/21/22, 7:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: and thus your slowing down increases
9/21/22, 7:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: mass of your own object? no, not really, it depends on contact surface area in this case
9/21/22, 7:50 PM - Ryan: Ok
9/21/22, 7:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: well this is too large to explain tbh

1) no perception of time is inherently true
2) but everyone can agree that speed of light is exactly _c_ in a vacuum
3) then how is no perception true? what if you go fast? and then shone a light? well your light would still be going c for all observers
4) there are experiments to prove above conjecture
5) to account for these effects, various relativistic effects are observed (time dilation which in turn leads to a lot of other things such as newtonianly-unpredictably changing your momentum when you go at very fast speeds)
6) the reason this happens well because of a theory that things like gravity don't necessarily cause motion paths to bend, but they instead bend a thing called spacetime, so when your object moves along it, it moves in geodesics and ultimately gravity does not bend it
9/21/22, 7:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: time is a dimension
the space itself is a thing which is made of 3 spatial dimensions

people join these two things together because motion and time and interlinked, and because of relativistic effects one affects the other, so they are essentially the same thing. the ideas of spacetime and their equations also get a lot simpler as you now only have to predict where and how something moves through just spacetime using those equations, instead of doing it separately for space and time
9/21/22, 7:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
9/21/22, 7:53 PM - Ryan: Impossible
9/21/22, 7:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: i don't know, im not good at chemistry üòÉ

rna cannot self replicate, rna has diff sugar in it than dna, ribose vs deoxyribose

what is the role of ribose? well i don't know why rna specifically has ribose, why not something else but the rna is in part made of it. and ig sugar, biologically that's what makes sense to make things out of? any small molecules, because so much sugar and so many types of sugar
9/21/22, 7:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: and i don't know how its related to phosphorus or nitrogen
9/21/22, 7:57 PM - Ryan: Oh I meant the requirement of phosphorus and nitrogen in DNA
9/21/22, 7:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: ah
9/21/22, 7:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: well nitrogen make protein ig üòÉ phosphorus do tons of cool things like atp and membrane formation

uhhhhhhhh so idk how that's involved in dna, but again these are common in cell so cell use it to form dna?
9/21/22, 7:59 PM - Ryan: Ok
9/21/22, 7:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: So
9/21/22, 8:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: Is question time done
9/21/22, 8:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: Can I meet my family now
9/21/22, 8:00 PM - Ryan: I don't know
9/21/22, 8:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ryan please it's difficult to breathe in the basement
9/21/22, 8:00 PM - Ryan: Or is it
9/21/22, 8:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠bro im dying there's no air ventilation jrhhdhfhdjehdhfh
9/21/22, 8:01 PM - Ryan: Why is there no ventilation
9/21/22, 8:01 PM - Ryan: Probably to prevent the escape from the basement by the prisoner
9/21/22, 8:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: to avoid impostor traversing around the basement?
9/21/22, 8:01 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Lmao
9/21/22, 8:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
9/21/22, 8:01 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Ok so
9/21/22, 8:01 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Who came first
9/21/22, 8:02 PM - Ryan: But in real life, the vents are not pretty comfortable for escaping

It would not be a pleasant experience for the prisoner
9/21/22, 8:02 PM - Aditya Vardhan: The chicken
9/21/22, 8:02 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Or
9/21/22, 8:02 PM - Aditya Vardhan: The
9/21/22, 8:02 PM - Ryan: I maybe I just need to make vents small enough
9/21/22, 8:02 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Human
9/21/22, 8:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: Better than asphyxiation
9/21/22, 8:02 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Do you know how to tie a tie
9/21/22, 8:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: NOOOO
9/21/22, 8:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: don't remind me of how useless I am in society
9/21/22, 8:03 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Do you know how to murder a chicken
9/21/22, 8:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: oh yes i do
9/21/22, 8:03 PM - Aditya Vardhan: What about humans
9/21/22, 8:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: i observed Amritansh murdering one
9/21/22, 8:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: ohhh yes i do
9/21/22, 8:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: it's easy
9/21/22, 8:03 PM - Aditya Vardhan: This message was deleted
9/21/22, 8:03 PM - Ryan: And one problem with vents is that I think if they have one of their ends in the outside

I think the sound can travel from the vents to a person who may hear the Cries
9/21/22, 8:03 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Just tie a tie to tight
9/21/22, 8:03 PM - Aditya Vardhan: And hang on fan
9/21/22, 8:04 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Hogya
9/21/22, 8:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: sound travels faster through solids but in turn amplitude goes down, ig
9/21/22, 8:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: that's why no one can hear me scream
9/21/22, 8:04 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Lmao anant ko tie bandhna nahi aata
9/21/22, 8:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: but i know how to kill you

Factory farming sad
9/21/22, 8:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: male baby chickens
9/21/22, 8:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes incredibly sad
9/21/22, 8:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: and non-factory farming? well
9/21/22, 8:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: its a lot more expensice
9/21/22, 8:07 PM - Ryan: Organic farming yes
9/21/22, 8:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: and hurts environment and stuff more
9/21/22, 8:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: more resources
9/21/22, 8:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: more inefficient
9/21/22, 8:08 PM - Ryan: A lot of area and capital

A lot of methane
9/21/22, 8:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: so chose between efficiency and suffering
9/21/22, 8:08 PM - Aditya Vardhan: <Media omitted>
9/21/22, 8:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: walter

food

they're very inefficient at converting grain into meat
9/21/22, 8:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: methane is a very significant contributor to climate change
9/21/22, 8:08 PM - Ryan: Yes
9/21/22, 8:09 PM - Ryan: What about artificial meat?

Made of plant proteins?
9/21/22, 8:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: so meat farming makes up quite a large portion of emissions by damage
9/21/22, 8:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: more ethical
9/21/22, 8:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: pretty tasty too apparently
9/21/22, 8:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: but more expensive
9/21/22, 8:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: and in less countries
9/21/22, 8:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: unhealthier too in some cases

but I'd go with artificial meat

if it was a thing in india
9/21/22, 8:10 PM - Ryan: What about something much more unethical
9/21/22, 8:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: Human meat is considered unethical
9/21/22, 8:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: Because apparently being social allows for more emotions?
9/21/22, 8:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: but cmon
9/21/22, 8:11 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Hol up
9/21/22, 8:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: we murder so many chickens and cows
9/21/22, 8:11 PM - Aditya Vardhan: That's discrimination
9/21/22, 8:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
9/21/22, 8:11 PM - Ryan: What If we could just grow a massive flesh blob
9/21/22, 8:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: some places require them to be put to sleep

many places don't

and that's brutal
9/21/22, 8:12 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Very sad
9/21/22, 8:12 PM - Aditya Vardhan: I hope
9/21/22, 8:12 PM - Ryan: An artificial organism continuously protected from disease and decay that only serves the purpose to grow and provide us meat
9/21/22, 8:12 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes that's called skin of animals and there are disorders where people eat their own skin to some extent
9/21/22, 8:12 PM - Anant Tiwari: ah
9/21/22, 8:12 PM - Aditya Vardhan: I don't want to be a chicken in next life
9/21/22, 8:12 PM - Anant Tiwari: artificial
9/21/22, 8:12 PM - Anant Tiwari: well im literally worse than a fortnite bot
9/21/22, 8:12 PM - Anant Tiwari: so am i artificial aswell?
9/21/22, 8:12 PM - Ryan: But the problem is that this is immortality

This isn't possible as of now I think
9/21/22, 8:12 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
9/21/22, 8:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: but ya guys imma head out
9/21/22, 8:13 PM - Aditya Vardhan: People prefer brown egg over white
9/21/22, 8:13 PM - Aditya Vardhan: And that's racist

9/21/22, 8:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: WHAT I AM ABOUT TO DO ON A LARGE SCALE IN 60 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES
9/21/22, 8:13 PM - Ryan: Some examples
9/21/22, 8:13 PM - Aditya Vardhan: India no 1
9/21/22, 8:14 PM - Ryan: I think there is already a lot of racism and discrimination in India
9/21/22, 8:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: i am first flying to china

9/21/22, 8:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes I'm first person ever to book a flight to china
9/21/22, 8:15 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Why not kill horse
9/21/22, 8:15 PM - Aditya Vardhan: After all
9/21/22, 8:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: :(
9/21/22, 8:15 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Why not eat human
9/21/22, 8:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: @919818027773 were you responsible for this
9/21/22, 8:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: ü§®ü§®ü§®ü§®
9/21/22, 8:15 PM - Ryan: Why are the dogs suddenly attacking humans right now?

Or are the reporters just reporting the one side of the story
9/21/22, 8:15 PM - Aditya Vardhan: A basic solution to overpopulation
9/21/22, 8:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: one side of the story
9/21/22, 8:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: unbalanced reporting
9/21/22, 8:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: mass murder
9/21/22, 8:15 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Cannibalism
9/21/22, 8:15 PM - Dev: For what?
9/21/22, 8:15 PM - Ryan: My God, this should be illegal
9/21/22, 8:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes

9/21/22, 8:16 PM - Aditya Vardhan: They cute
9/21/22, 8:16 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Don't kill
9/21/22, 8:16 PM - Dev: Of what ?
9/21/22, 8:16 PM - Ryan: Economy issue

Cigarettes are sold a lot

Shouldn't they be arrested
9/21/22, 8:17 PM - Dev: Maybe
9/21/22, 8:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: they should be

9/21/22, 8:17 PM - Ryan: Dictatorship

Do what you think is right?
9/21/22, 8:17 PM - Dev: Butter
9/21/22, 8:18 PM - Dev: This message was deleted
9/21/22, 8:18 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Nah
9/21/22, 8:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: I like dictatorship
9/21/22, 8:18 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Until the dictator is good
9/21/22, 8:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: null
9/21/22, 8:18 PM - Dev: Like monke
9/21/22, 8:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: stop censoring my opinion
9/21/22, 8:18 PM - Dev: I like when blood comes out
~anant 2022
9/21/22, 8:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: dictatorship
9/21/22, 8:19 PM - Amritansh: ...
9/21/22, 8:19 PM - Dev: <Media omitted>
9/21/22, 8:20 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Chup
9/21/22, 8:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: i didn't say that
9/21/22, 8:20 PM - Aditya Vardhan: This message was deleted
9/21/22, 8:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: you could say
9/21/22, 8:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: dev has spun a rather long yarn
9/21/22, 8:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: fabricated a story!
9/21/22, 8:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: yesss
9/21/22, 8:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: guys
9/21/22, 8:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: vote for me
9/21/22, 8:21 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Na
9/21/22, 8:21 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Democracy
9/21/22, 8:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: bro campaigning
9/21/22, 8:21 PM - Aditya Vardhan: I am opposition
9/21/22, 8:21 PM - Ryan: Why do we need such a cycle?

Shouldn't it end for all

People would continue to eat, kill, etc etc till they exist

Everything that is alive on earth has committed a necessary evil

Why do we need this existence? Burdened by hunger,sleep,thirst and other useless desires

It should end
9/21/22, 8:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: reacted to your own message
9/21/22, 8:21 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Now give some promises so that people vote
9/21/22, 8:21 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Chup
9/21/22, 8:22 PM - Aditya Vardhan: I wil oppose
9/21/22, 8:22 PM - Ryan: It would all collapse one day

But unfortunately again a new superior race would rise

And then they will fall again
9/21/22, 8:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: well because existence is sometimes fun
9/21/22, 8:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: who says it all collapse
9/21/22, 8:22 PM - Dev: Imagine reacting to your own message
9/21/22, 8:22 PM - Dev: Who would do that?
9/21/22, 8:22 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Chup
9/21/22, 8:22 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Poocha Maine?
9/21/22, 8:22 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Chup
9/21/22, 8:22 PM - Dev: Na
9/21/22, 8:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: we've gotten pretty far along in evolution unless silurian hypothesis is true

in 1 week we are testing asteroid deflection mechanisms
9/21/22, 8:23 PM - Ryan: Existence is made to be sometimes fun

So we would want to continue existing

Sadness and happiness is an illusion

There is no thing which can be associated completely to these feelings
9/21/22, 8:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: what?
9/21/22, 8:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: ofcourse it is an illusion
9/21/22, 8:23 PM - Ryan: Either humans would die on their own or someone or something would end their existence
9/21/22, 8:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: yea
9/21/22, 8:23 PM - Dev: <Media omitted>
9/21/22, 8:23 PM - Amritansh: Guys
9/21/22, 8:23 PM - Dev: Say goodbye

9/21/22, 8:23 PM - Amritansh: I am at 396/400 in ut 2
9/21/22, 8:24 PM - Amritansh: 4 wrong (total) in 5 exams
9/21/22, 8:24 PM - Dev: Monke
9/21/22, 8:24 PM - Dev: Poocha maine?
9/21/22, 8:24 PM - Amritansh: YOOOOO
9/21/22, 8:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: or you could continue living and technology would progress to help you live forever, to control your brain to give you dopamine and shit without the harm of drugs and stuff
9/21/22, 8:24 PM - Dev: Flex kar raha hai
9/21/22, 8:24 PM - Ryan: A lot of crimes are committed daily

Existence is not worth it
9/21/22, 8:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: who cares if crimes are committed
9/21/22, 8:24 PM - Amritansh: No
9/21/22, 8:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: most people die from heart disease
9/21/22, 8:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: not murder
9/21/22, 8:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: cancers
9/21/22, 8:24 PM - Amritansh: I was continuing to ask your marks
9/21/22, 8:25 PM - Ryan: Probably

But these crimes, even though not that common as many think, are nasty
9/21/22, 8:25 PM - Amritansh: @917838968821 how many marks in total out of 400 rn?
9/21/22, 8:25 PM - Amritansh: @919717944490?
9/21/22, 8:25 PM - Ryan: These will keep happening
9/21/22, 8:25 PM - Amritansh: @919999373163
9/21/22, 8:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: i dont care if they're nasty
9/21/22, 8:25 PM - Ryan: 0/400
9/21/22, 8:25 PM - Amritansh: Oh
9/21/22, 8:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: the animal kingdom does awful shit
9/21/22, 8:25 PM - Ryan: Do you

we're the lucky few which don't have to face that
9/21/22, 8:26 PM - Amritansh: I didn't have to do this.
9/21/22, 8:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: so I'd say cherish it
9/21/22, 8:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: fine
9/21/22, 8:30 PM - You joined using this group's invite link
9/21/22, 8:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: i just rickrolled myself
9/21/22, 8:30 PM - Amritansh 2: Anant
9/21/22, 8:30 PM - Amritansh 2: You broke the rules
9/21/22, 8:30 PM - Amritansh 2: You didn't see me coming did you?
9/21/22, 8:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: which ruke
9/21/22, 8:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: please mention
9/21/22, 8:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: because neither of those words were profanities
9/21/22, 8:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: so in conclusion: joe mama
9/21/22, 8:31 PM - Ryan: What are some war crimes committed by adelie penguins, sea otters, bed bugs etc

There was a sea bug too I think that was much more psychopathic
9/21/22, 8:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: many animals kill their own children
9/21/22, 8:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: do humans do that
9/21/22, 8:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
9/21/22, 8:32 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Not on purpose
9/21/22, 8:32 PM - Ryan: That is that nasty
9/21/22, 8:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: and that makes it better?
9/21/22, 8:32 PM - Aditya Vardhan: No but like
9/21/22, 8:32 PM - Aditya Vardhan: If someone kill on purpose
9/21/22, 8:32 PM - Aditya Vardhan: It's worse
9/21/22, 8:32 PM - Aditya Vardhan: So yes it makes it better
9/21/22, 8:32 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Emotional
9/21/22, 8:32 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Y
9/21/22, 8:32 PM - Ryan: You sure

Under stress some animals like rabbits and rats would eat their children on purpose
9/21/22, 8:32 PM - Amritansh: You joined the group without permission @917838968821
9/21/22, 8:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes

we've learnt to cope with stress
9/21/22, 8:32 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Mostly don't kill on purpose
9/21/22, 8:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: thats not a rule
9/21/22, 8:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: you never said it was
9/21/22, 8:33 PM - Amritansh: This leaves me with no choice.
9/21/22, 8:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: you never said it was a rule!
9/21/22, 8:33 PM - Amritansh: Yws
9/21/22, 8:33 PM - Amritansh: But.
9/21/22, 8:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: therefore if you remove me, that would be unconstitutional
9/21/22, 8:33 PM - Amritansh: It is a universal rule.
9/21/22, 8:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: no it is not.
9/21/22, 8:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: there are many groups where this is not implied
9/21/22, 8:33 PM - Amritansh: <Media omitted>
9/21/22, 8:33 PM - Amritansh: Literally
9/21/22, 8:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: therefore you must have defined
9/21/22, 8:33 PM - Ryan: There are more

Research about Adelie penguins and their war crimes

I think you know about the war crimes committed by dolphins
9/21/22, 8:33 PM - Amritansh: Bin bulae mehman
9/21/22, 8:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: No, that's not a rule
9/21/22, 8:33 PM - Ryan: Research about some sea otters too
9/21/22, 8:33 PM - Amritansh: THAT IS.
9/21/22, 8:34 PM - Amritansh: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
9/21/22, 8:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: Please confirm with Charu mam
9/21/22, 8:34 PM - Amritansh: OK bye

9/21/22, 8:36 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: what
9/21/22, 8:36 PM - Aditya Vardhan: He dosent know everything
9/21/22, 8:38 PM - Ryan: Also the sea louse is a pretty disgusting animal

The females of the species kind of suffer a lot I think
9/21/22, 8:38 PM - Ryan: The children literally eat their way out
9/21/22, 8:39 PM - Ryan: But that is not the only case
9/21/22, 8:39 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: do you suggest that I should search it up?
9/21/22, 8:39 PM - Ryan: No
9/21/22, 8:39 PM - Ryan: Unless you want some trauma
9/21/22, 8:39 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: you're making me curious

9/22/22, 3:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: Try monkeytype every day
9/22/22, 3:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: It will take a few months but you can do much faster if you dedicate
9/22/22, 3:46 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: lmao

9/22/22, 3:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: 1000 wpm?
9/22/22, 3:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: lemme do
9/22/22, 3:58 PM - Aditya Vardhan: What's the world record
9/22/22, 3:58 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Let's see
9/22/22, 3:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: sustained is different from burst
9/22/22, 3:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: burst people have probably got 300wpm+
9/22/22, 3:58 PM - Aditya Vardhan: 212
9/22/22, 3:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: sustained it was some random woman on a typewriter 100 years ago
9/22/22, 3:58 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Is world record
9/22/22, 3:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: not even close lmao
9/22/22, 3:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: that's bs
9/22/22, 3:58 PM - Aditya Vardhan: What
9/22/22, 3:58 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Whta
9/22/22, 3:58 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Bs
9/22/22, 3:58 PM - Aditya Vardhan: ?
9/22/22, 3:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: people have typed sustained faster than that
9/22/22, 3:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: bullshit
9/22/22, 3:59 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Bs
9/22/22, 3:59 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Totally
9/22/22, 3:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: many people have videos, of monkeytype, 10fastfingers etc
9/22/22, 3:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: and for shorter durations even faster is possible
9/22/22, 3:59 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Then why didint they update
9/22/22, 3:59 PM - Aditya Vardhan: They memorize so basically that's cheating
9/22/22, 3:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: because, guiness book of world records is stupid
9/22/22, 3:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: no not memorization
9/22/22, 3:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: random words
9/22/22, 4:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: my highest was 180wpm for 4 seconds
9/22/22, 4:00 PM - Aditya Vardhan: memorize the random words so like headstart
9/22/22, 4:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: but for 30s or 1m test its much much lower
9/22/22, 4:00 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Like
9/22/22, 4:00 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Let's see
9/22/22, 4:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: the words get generated after you start
9/22/22, 4:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: in the tests they use
9/22/22, 4:00 PM - Aditya Vardhan: What
9/22/22, 4:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: and you can disable it even in monketype
9/22/22, 4:00 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Monkey type me to Aisa nahi hota
9/22/22, 4:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: chup
9/22/22, 4:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: + no one memorizes, it's very lame and doesn't help that much either
9/22/22, 4:01 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Welp i did so i thought they might too
9/22/22, 4:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: sustained tests usually means over a minute

monkeytype will show you about a quarter or sixth of that even if you dont enable the option
9/22/22, 4:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: it's ok
9/22/22, 4:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: a lot of ppl do when starting
9/22/22, 4:02 PM - Aditya Vardhan: I still have to look at the keyboard
9/22/22, 4:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: but it's better to practice without memorizing
9/22/22, 4:02 PM - Aditya Vardhan: So
9/22/22, 4:02 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Not good
9/22/22, 4:02 PM - Aditya Vardhan: I need to practice
9/22/22, 4:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: Try to touch type ie type without looking at keyboard
9/22/22, 4:02 PM - Aditya Vardhan: I do
9/22/22, 4:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: on laptop especially its important
9/22/22, 4:02 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Spelling mistakes go berr
9/22/22, 4:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: Practice makes an Aditya Vardhan Singh perfect

9/23/22, 11:47 AM - Anant Tiwari: We removed everyone
9/23/22, 12:05 PM - Ryan: What is the difference between primitive subsistence farming and intensive subsistence farming
9/23/22, 12:06 PM - Aditya Vardhan: I donno
9/23/22, 12:06 PM - Aditya Vardhan: They are pretty much the same
9/23/22, 12:06 PM - Aditya Vardhan: In book
9/23/22, 12:06 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Not explained properly
9/23/22, 12:06 PM - Ryan: Wait...no I think
9/23/22, 12:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: primitive - using old technology, maybe moving around

intensive - work on a small plot of land using a lot of resources, no moving around, requires more technology, done if land is too expensive
9/23/22, 12:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
9/23/22, 12:07 PM - Ryan: I think after doing the worksheets

I assume that a lot of questions are going to be "different"

Not discussed with us
9/23/22, 12:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: intensive - giving something intense care

intensely looking after field, like adding manures fertilizers and stuff too
9/23/22, 12:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: yessssss
9/23/22, 12:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: exactly
9/23/22, 12:07 PM - Aditya Vardhan: No major difference
9/23/22, 12:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: like soch ke likhna padega
9/23/22, 12:07 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Like
9/23/22, 12:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: there's a major difference
9/23/22, 12:07 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Ok i accept

9/23/22, 12:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes sure
9/23/22, 12:08 PM - Aditya Vardhan: 2D
9/23/22, 12:08 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Todd
9/23/22, 12:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: also intensive requires like good climate throughout year
9/23/22, 12:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: i thonk üòÉ
9/23/22, 12:08 PM - Ryan: Ok
9/23/22, 12:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: but i don't understand why

9/23/22, 12:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: Why would he?
9/23/22, 12:09 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Noobda
9/23/22, 12:09 PM - Ryan: The farmer aims for the maximum output from the small piece of land I think?

In intensive farming, more than a single crop are grown in the same year I think, which would require favorable climate for the whole year I think
9/23/22, 12:10 PM - Aditya Vardhan: He did
9/23/22, 12:10 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Already

9/23/22, 4:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: you know in functions some arguments can be passed by setting arg variable to the value only? so any argument which you have to pass like that must always come at end of the other arguments

9/23/22, 10:40 PM - Ryan: We attended school and gave exams in a literal pandemic

How can some rain and flooding stop us
9/23/22, 10:40 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Pandemic is over ryan
9/23/22, 10:40 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Almost
9/23/22, 10:40 PM - Ryan: There will always be another

9/23/22, 11:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: as always unnecessary pessimism

Ofcourse there's gonna be another one soon and it's going to kill millions but crying about it won't fix it
9/23/22, 11:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: nor will it raise awareness towards it
9/23/22, 11:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: people know we aren't prepared
9/23/22, 11:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: no one claimed we were
9/23/22, 11:04 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Are you sure that you are not in comma
9/23/22, 11:04 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Are you sure that you are not dreaming
9/23/22, 11:04 PM - Dev: Na
9/23/22, 11:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: well, I'm pretty sure as the thoughts i have right now are sequential and my dreams are not like that
9/23/22, 11:05 PM - Dev: Na
9/23/22, 11:05 PM - Dev: Na
9/23/22, 11:05 PM - Dev: Naan
9/23/22, 11:05 PM - Aditya Vardhan: As time in dream is streched we can be possibly in a dream
9/23/22, 11:05 PM - Aditya Vardhan: A long one
9/23/22, 11:05 PM - Dev: Is kind of a roti
9/23/22, 11:05 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: maidi
9/23/22, 11:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
9/23/22, 11:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: i don't know man
9/23/22, 11:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: my dreams feel short while I'm in them
9/23/22, 11:05 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Then they are very short irl
9/23/22, 11:05 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Like 2-3 seconds dream
9/23/22, 11:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: i remember 30 seconds of it, and that's the same 30 seconds i felt when experiencing
9/23/22, 11:06 PM - Aditya Vardhan: But in dream they must feel long
9/23/22, 11:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: wr can never be sure
9/23/22, 11:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: maybe you are dead
9/23/22, 11:06 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Btw you forget almost 90 percent of dreams as you wake up
9/23/22, 11:06 PM - Aditya Vardhan: So
9/23/22, 11:06 PM - Aditya Vardhan: üòÉ
9/23/22, 11:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: what is to be dead if it is indistinguishable from the normal thought or no thought cycle? what is it to dream
9/23/22, 11:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: cope karlo
9/23/22, 11:07 PM - Aditya Vardhan: I just remember 2 dreams
9/23/22, 11:07 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Properly
9/23/22, 11:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: in conclusion thog dc as life sometimes good life sometimes bad
9/23/22, 11:07 PM - Aditya Vardhan: And i dream almost every day
9/23/22, 11:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: good
9/23/22, 11:07 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Average person dreams 6 times
9/23/22, 11:08 PM - Aditya Vardhan: And dreaming is not a very good thing
9/23/22, 11:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: in their life?
9/23/22, 11:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: are you sure
9/23/22, 11:08 PM - Aditya Vardhan: No
9/23/22, 11:08 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Everyday
9/23/22, 11:08 PM - Aditya Vardhan: 6 time
9/23/22, 11:08 PM - Aditya Vardhan: To 4 time
9/23/22, 11:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes that's true
9/23/22, 11:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: dreams are very segmented
9/23/22, 11:08 PM - Aditya Vardhan: It depends on person tho
9/23/22, 11:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: you can notice the jumps
9/23/22, 11:08 PM - Aditya Vardhan: And nightmares are the scariest part of sleeping
9/23/22, 11:09 PM - Aditya Vardhan: I remember when I was smaller sleepin was a punishment
9/23/22, 11:09 PM - Aditya Vardhan: And now it's like a reward

9/23/22, 11:28 PM - Ryan: Wait...crying?

Wasn't it acceptance
9/23/22, 11:28 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: bhai test vid hai
9/23/22, 11:28 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: smth wrong with quality
9/23/22, 11:29 PM - Ryan: Microbes and diseases are very interesting

They have a lot of potential

Both as medicine and a weapon
9/23/22, 11:29 PM - Ryan: Truly magnificent
9/23/22, 11:31 PM - Ryan: This pandemic wasn't even serious

It could have definitely stretched for a longer period of time

Minimum 5 to 10 years I think

But because we are technological advanced and a person uploaded the information regarding the genetic structure of the virus on the internet(i think, could be wrong here) we were able to find a vaccine faster
9/23/22, 11:31 PM - Ryan: We are definitely not prepared for such pandemics

Because people are dumb

There is always some doubt, suspicion, some superstition in people

Can we get rid of it?
9/23/22, 11:32 PM - Ryan: I have some superstitious beliefs, I am dumb quite a lot of times

Everyone is I think

Atleast a little bit
9/23/22, 11:34 PM - Ryan: There is always a bit of attraction towards easy solutions

Beliefs that rid us of the stress, the thinking, the hard work to find solutions

Beliefs which out of no where just explain things

Without any proof

Still they are attractive?

Why?

9/23/22, 11:34 PM - Ryan: I don't know

I am just a little negative I think

9/23/22, 11:57 PM - Ryan: Why can diseases be so lethal? So wierd? So potent?

This poison manufactures itself on its own

It can hijack your body, make you die in the worst way possible

They can do things with our body which we probably don't we even know of

Or do we?

I don't know

Can each cell be hijacked?

Is there any limit to the symptoms?

Rabies is so strange, wierd and spooky

This ophiocordyceps unilateralis (cool name?) is literally a zombie fungus for ants

Truly can be the subject for the best of fictions

So many of them, so different, so scary

They are beautiful in a sense
9/23/22, 11:58 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: good night Ryan
9/23/22, 11:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: still srry if my reply was rude
9/23/22, 11:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: i didnt mean crying over pandemic i just meant worrying too much ovr it cant be conteolled
9/23/22, 11:59 PM - Ryan: There is a brain eating amoeba

Sounds cool? Sounds scary? I don't know

I don't know anything about diseases

The definition for the strategy of non-interference is given below in 5
9/24/22, 2:52 PM - Ryan: Hmm who actually wants to do a job?

Doesn't everyone want money

If we could get the money without having to do a job then why do a job.

For passion?For fun?
9/24/22, 3:01 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: most jobs aren't fun
9/24/22, 3:02 PM - Ryan: Are you sure

Depends on the person I think
9/24/22, 3:02 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yea?

would you like to work a 9-5 and get paid 10-20k per month
9/24/22, 3:03 PM - Ryan: There are so more types of jobs
9/24/22, 3:03 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yea, most people don't enjoy them

only some do
9/24/22, 3:04 PM - Ryan: Because they do them for money
9/24/22, 3:04 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: exactly

9/24/22, 8:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: 26million pounds
9/24/22, 8:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: he left with from india
9/24/22, 8:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: according to wikipedia
9/24/22, 8:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: 2021
9/24/22, 8:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: so 1.8 billion roughly
9/24/22, 8:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: rupeez
9/24/22, 8:01 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: inflation üôÅüòî
9/24/22, 8:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: deflation üòÉüòÉüéàüí•
9/24/22, 8:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: wait

when a balloon explodes it inflates and then deflates
when a balloon deflates it implodes
9/24/22, 8:06 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: the
9/24/22, 8:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: so a balloon deflating is an explosion and then an implosion?

or do both happen at the same time?
9/24/22, 8:06 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: No, not the questions please
9/24/22, 8:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: as soon as it tears apart and the explosion officially begins, it no longer contains anything, so does it really inflate?
9/24/22, 8:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: When does an explosion begin?
9/24/22, 8:07 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: I'm afraid you have the major curiosity disease
9/24/22, 8:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: Probably in a few seconds

9/24/22, 8:13 PM - Ryan: What
9/24/22, 8:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: No no
9/24/22, 8:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: A balloon deflating is an implosion
9/24/22, 8:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: But why does it deflate?
9/24/22, 8:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: Because it tears and it explodes
9/24/22, 8:13 PM - Ryan: No asbestos? No Formaldehyde?No Chromyl Chloride?

No jews? Wait
9/24/22, 8:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
9/24/22, 8:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: üòéüòéüòé
9/24/22, 8:14 PM - Ryan: Probably yes

Gases expanding probably I don't know
9/24/22, 8:14 PM - Ryan: What is implosion
9/24/22, 8:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: thog
9/24/22, 8:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: when surrounding pressure force you into slime

a region much lower pressure than surrounding so it get crush

so i don't think it implodes
9/24/22, 8:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: but deflation really feels like it should be an implosion
9/24/22, 8:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: it depends on the cause
9/24/22, 8:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: well no it would definitely be an explosion
9/24/22, 8:16 PM - Ryan: What are some really good carcinogens?
9/24/22, 8:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: high pressure inside balloon, sure it gets smaller but that's not necessarily an implosion
9/24/22, 8:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: in conclusion i am stupid
9/24/22, 8:16 PM - Ryan: Ok
9/24/22, 8:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: radonüòÉ

9/24/22, 8:22 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: I remember, there used to be this cream for pain relief ig?

but it was sold for medicine purposes

people before used to put it in bread and consume it

because it used to make you high

no harmful effects on the body
9/24/22, 8:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: now what happens to superfluids, i don't know

9/25/22, 9:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: And then force you to give me your passwords with a gun
9/25/22, 9:11 PM - Aditya Vardhan: 9:11
9/25/22, 9:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: That's coercion
9/25/22, 9:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: Now imagine if I was the government
9/25/22, 9:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: govmint
9/25/22, 9:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: And I did thst
9/25/22, 9:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: that's also coercion
9/25/22, 9:11 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Then what
9/25/22, 9:11 PM - Aditya Vardhan: What how
9/25/22, 9:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: and now imagine if i did that in terms of religion
9/25/22, 9:12 PM - Aditya Vardhan: It should be legal
9/25/22, 9:12 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Right
9/25/22, 9:12 PM - Dev: GOVMINT*

9/25/22, 9:12 PM - Aditya Vardhan: And that's illegal

like coercion, you don't need to be government but in the context of understanding secularism chapter that's what it means
9/25/22, 9:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: Coercing is illegal
9/25/22, 9:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: I mean your mom can coerce you to do your homework, that's not illegal

9/26/22, 2:34 PM - Ryan: I am failing
9/26/22, 2:34 PM - Ryan: I wrote none of the answers in points
9/26/22, 2:39 PM - Ryan: And also

Wasn't their relationship with EIC already bad

Didn't Haidar Ali fought EIC already?
9/26/22, 2:45 PM - Ryan: This time Darash,Anant,Siddarth and Dev would replace me as toppers
9/26/22, 2:49 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 were you able to write a note on the Battle of Plassey in points?

I think I wrote so many lines that marks would be cut
9/26/22, 2:50 PM - Dev: No
9/26/22, 2:50 PM - Dev: I will fail
9/26/22, 2:50 PM - Dev: No
9/26/22, 2:50 PM - Dev: I was not able to
9/26/22, 2:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: Doesn't matter
9/26/22, 2:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: I wrote like 2 in points
9/26/22, 2:51 PM - Dev: Samosa
9/26/22, 2:51 PM - Dev: Lmao
9/26/22, 2:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: Mam will just check if ans has correct info or not
9/26/22, 2:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
9/26/22, 2:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: A note is a note
9/26/22, 2:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: Not a bulletin board
9/26/22, 2:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: I think the wars happened after Tipu stopped trades
9/26/22, 2:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: Unless there have been more wars before which weren't mentioned in book
9/26/22, 3:06 PM - Ryan: Ok
9/26/22, 3:06 PM - Ryan: Hmm wait I think one was fought with Haider Ali too
9/26/22, 3:07 PM - Ryan: The growth of Mysore concerned the EIC I think

And the Coast was also in the hands of the Mysore Rulers from where the Company bought some nice stuff

So the war was probably for the control

And the stopped trading with the EIC was fuel to the fire probably I don't know
9/26/22, 3:08 PM - Ryan: Tipu Sultans had some rockets too?
9/26/22, 3:08 PM - Ryan: Which he used against the British?
9/26/22, 3:15 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Will do better next time

I think I am a little overconfident and tired after SSC
9/26/22, 6:30 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 How are electromagnetic waves with extremely short wavelengths able to rip electron out of atoms (if it's true i don't know I am stupid)
9/26/22, 6:35 PM - Dev: I donno
9/26/22, 6:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: short wavelength = high frequency = lot more energy in the wave for same amplitude of em wave, this energy ionises the atom
9/26/22, 6:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: fun fact it can even break apart the nucleus

you just have to apply enough energy
9/26/22, 6:43 PM - Tanmaya: Is general awareness coming in AI?
9/26/22, 6:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
9/26/22, 6:44 PM - Tanmaya: Ok

Why is red red?

What are colours?

Is there even any colour or is it just our perception?
9/26/22, 6:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: perception
9/26/22, 6:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: i mena colour does exist
9/26/22, 6:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: if you count frequency of em waves to be property
9/26/22, 6:50 PM - Ryan: How do timebombs work?

9/26/22, 6:52 PM - Navya: aur usse defuse karne ke liye uski wire kar ye h
9/26/22, 6:52 PM - Navya: A time bomb (or a timebomb, time-bomb) is a bomb whose¬†detonation is triggered by a timer. The use (or attempted use) of time bombs has been for various purposes including insurance fraud, terrorism, assassination, sabotage and warfare.
9/26/22, 6:52 PM - Navya: @919717944490

9/26/22, 7:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: please let me drink chai in peace
9/26/22, 7:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: many types of yeast, so these types are the different single celled fungi while yeast refers to all of them which are unicellular
9/26/22, 7:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: _acet_ obacter _acet_ i

Probably microbe which makes acetic acid
9/26/22, 7:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: so where can we get it for free
9/26/22, 7:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

9/26/22, 7:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: Thx for helping you helped some contribution and that's what matters
9/26/22, 7:45 PM - Ryan: Do our olfactory nerves react to all types of molecules
9/26/22, 7:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: No?
9/26/22, 7:57 PM - Navya: what
9/26/22, 7:57 PM - Aditya Vardhan: I should study
9/26/22, 7:58 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Mc PvP very tough
9/26/22, 7:58 PM - Aditya Vardhan: They banned autoclicker
9/26/22, 7:58 PM - Aditya Vardhan: What i do
9/26/22, 7:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: BHAI
9/26/22, 7:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: ITS BANNED FOR A REASON!!!
9/26/22, 7:58 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Yes
9/26/22, 7:58 PM - Aditya Vardhan: To
9/26/22, 7:59 PM - Aditya Vardhan: I can't win
9/26/22, 7:59 PM - Aditya Vardhan: So i bought autoclicker
9/26/22, 7:59 PM - Aditya Vardhan: But they banned autoclicker
9/26/22, 7:59 PM - Aditya Vardhan: üòÉ
9/26/22, 7:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: Others work so hard to improve their aim while clicking 8 cps so they get the initial kb hit every time

You install a software which does that for you, so in 99% of run-ups you'll hit first, inflict knockback, they get pushed back, their sprint gets cancelled and you keep clicking

Autoclicker is extremely overpowered
9/26/22, 7:59 PM - Aditya Vardhan: üò≠
9/26/22, 7:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: Go practice it or play a different game
9/26/22, 7:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: Don't cheat in multi-player games
9/26/22, 7:59 PM - Aditya Vardhan: <Media omitted>
9/26/22, 8:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: its with random people and these people work very hard to maintain streak
9/26/22, 8:00 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Yea
9/26/22, 8:00 PM - Aditya Vardhan: I wplay mc survival
9/26/22, 8:00 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Multiplayer survival
9/26/22, 8:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: Or you can try playing 1.9+ pvp
9/26/22, 8:00 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Ye kya he
9/26/22, 8:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: CPS matters much less

Even in 1.8 it doesn't matter much
9/26/22, 8:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: like versions 1.9 and above
9/26/22, 8:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: they changed combat system
9/26/22, 8:00 PM - Ryan: Why?
9/26/22, 8:01 PM - Aditya Vardhan: So i should play below 1.9
9/26/22, 8:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: dev can testify to this statement
9/26/22, 8:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: No, play above
9/26/22, 8:01 PM - Aditya Vardhan: I already do
9/26/22, 8:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: And find pvp server for 1.9+
9/26/22, 8:01 PM - Aditya Vardhan: I lose
9/26/22, 8:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: No you don't
9/26/22, 8:01 PM - Aditya Vardhan: I did
9/26/22, 8:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: In 1.9 there is attack cooldown
9/26/22, 8:01 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Shield
9/26/22, 8:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: In 1.8 there is essentially not
9/26/22, 8:01 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Axe
9/26/22, 8:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yea
9/26/22, 8:01 PM - Aditya Vardhan: I will
9/26/22, 8:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: Autoclicker is useless in 1.9, it's pretty much worse than clicking on your own
9/26/22, 8:02 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Ok so
9/26/22, 8:02 PM - Aditya Vardhan: I will play
9/26/22, 8:02 PM - Aditya Vardhan: 1.9
9/26/22, 8:02 PM - Aditya Vardhan: +
9/26/22, 8:22 PM - Dev: This message was deleted
9/26/22, 8:22 PM - Dev: This message was deleted
9/26/22, 8:23 PM - Dev: Yes
9/26/22, 8:23 PM - Dev: Yes
9/26/22, 8:23 PM - Dev: What is the matter if you get 20 cps but can not aim
9/26/22, 8:24 PM - Dev: Yes
It is because in the new version of mc there is a delay between using the wepon the  first time and using it the second time, the delay is different for different weapons. In the older gen like 1.8.9(which is the best) there is no such delay which is good for pvp and minigames like bedwars, skyward and THE BRIDGE
9/26/22, 8:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: Exactly
9/26/22, 8:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: THE BRIDGE

or
a == 420

9/26/22, 9:25 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: synat
9/26/22, 9:25 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: x
9/26/22, 9:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
9/26/22, 9:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: but you gotta understand why the syntax is the way it is instead of memorizing
9/26/22, 9:26 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: pyton
9/26/22, 9:31 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: anant were you typing
9/26/22, 9:31 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yes he is
9/26/22, 9:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: thou shalle≈•hn't merozieth coding! thou shalle≈•h understand.

any condition is converted into True or False

if True: print("aaloo")
aaloo print hoga
if False: print("todd")
nothing will be printed

Any condition like 3>2, 5+1<7, "a" == "a" get converted into True or False

For example
if 3 > 2:

it turns into if True

and if statement is designed so if it sees True, it runs all the indented code
if it sees False, it does not do anything and just skips

so we want to make a condition where we check if a is either 69 or 420 or both

so this is essentially two checks:
if a == 69
if a == 420

but we can simplify it to "a == 69 or a == 420"

so when python sees that condition, it first converts the things to left and right of OR operator into True or False
is a == 69? if so, then a == 69 gets converted into True
is it 420? if so, then a == 420 gets converted into True
what if a was not 69? then a==69 would be converted to false

so lets say a = 69
python would go to if statement
if a == 69 or a == 420
a == 69 == True (a is indeed 69)
so it turns that into True
if True or a == 420:

now, a is NOT 420 so that gets converted into False
ie, if True or False

Now python even tries to simplify that
the OR operator checks if atleast one of the value is True, and if so, returns True
here, the value to the left of OR operator is True, ie atleast 1 value is True

so python converts "True or False" into "True"

if True

and as i said, if the if-statement sees True, it runs the indented code (the code which is tabbed)

so it'll print("bohot tez ho rahe ho:smirk:")

So what's the difference between the proper python syntax and your program?

For python to understand what part of the statement is the condition and what is not, the colon (:) exists

so essentially it treats whatever is between "if" and ":" as the condition

and as i said above, it simplifies the condition into True or False

so that is a glimpse of how the python interpreter works

tl;dr: don't ratta it, thou shalle≈•h understand first

9/28/22, 6:58 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: the chosen one
9/28/22, 6:58 AM - Ryan: Umm basically this sheet of paper shows your worth to the teachers and the schools

Other people may not know you, but they know your sheets


People first see your sheets then you

Sheets give you opportunity, it depends on you how will you use that opportunity
9/28/22, 6:58 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: sheets as in marksheets right?
9/28/22, 6:59 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: and exam sheets too im guessing
9/28/22, 6:59 AM - Ryan: Yes
9/28/22, 7:02 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: I remember getting A on every thing

in the class participation section

even though I never participated and never spoke lmao

the teachers still gave me an A
9/28/22, 7:02 AM - Ryan: And I think I will be absent today due to stomach issue

Please share what we did today after classes
9/28/22, 7:02 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: oh welp
9/28/22, 7:02 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: thog will share

9/28/22, 7:12 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: yea where you see the discipline, participation and all
9/28/22, 7:12 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: you know how they grade you on the basis of your behavior

9/28/22, 8:57 AM - Amritansh: Off to noidq
9/28/22, 8:57 AM - Amritansh: Noida*
9/28/22, 9:19 AM - Anant Tiwari: who has the time to check your marksheets

i don't remember the last time someone randomly asked me to tell all our marks

nor do teachers remember exactly how much someone got, just of some students, and they probably don't care

they don't see your sheets, 8th ut-2 marksheet will not be used by any employer
9/28/22, 9:19 AM - Anant Tiwari: same
9/28/22, 9:19 AM - Ryan: Yes
9/28/22, 9:19 AM - Ryan: But in higher classes

These marksheets would matter
9/28/22, 9:19 AM - Anant Tiwari: Higher classes = 11th
9/28/22, 9:20 AM - Ryan: üëå
9/28/22, 9:20 AM - Anant Tiwari: there is time
9/28/22, 9:20 AM - Anant Tiwari: so
9/28/22, 9:20 AM - Anant Tiwari: we shall not care
9/28/22, 9:20 AM - Anant Tiwari: we shall procrastinate worrying about the problem
9/28/22, 9:50 AM - Anant Tiwari: <Media omitted>
9/28/22, 12:21 PM - Ryan: 10th too I guess?
9/28/22, 12:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: depend karta hai
9/28/22, 12:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: but why do we care
9/28/22, 12:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: no one cares about our marks for now, we should not worry about them
9/28/22, 12:22 PM - Ryan: You Sure?
9/28/22, 12:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: i don't know man
9/28/22, 12:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: do you disagree
9/28/22, 12:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: do you think our sanskrit or English marks matter
9/28/22, 12:23 PM - Ryan: Yes kind of
9/28/22, 12:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: do they help us in life

will my teacher next year remember my marks
9/28/22, 12:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: wow
9/28/22, 12:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: but idk if ill take sanskrit next year
9/28/22, 12:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: so even if i get 0 how will it matter
9/28/22, 12:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: i mean above failing, whatever
9/28/22, 12:24 PM - Ryan: They impact overall percentage

And percentage defines the type of students of the school

The quality (kind of inhumane term)

A school's pride, it's strength is the students

And they use percentages to flex and attract more parents
9/28/22, 12:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: why would i care about the school's pride
9/28/22, 12:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes it affects overall percentage
9/28/22, 12:25 PM - Ryan: No

But it's their duty to remind you of your failures

So you work better

They temporarily care about your marks
9/28/22, 12:25 PM - Ryan: You wouldn't

The school cares
9/28/22, 12:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: yea my failure is to not be able to study 3 languages out of 7 subjects, of which ill use only one or maybe two
9/28/22, 12:26 PM - Ryan: Yes
9/28/22, 12:26 PM - Ryan: We all have our failures
9/28/22, 12:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes but studying SAMAS KE BHED is not useful for us unless we are interested in linguistics of hindi which i am personally not
9/28/22, 12:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: but whatever
9/28/22, 12:28 PM - Ryan: Yes it may not be useful
9/28/22, 12:58 PM - Amritansh: But I am
9/28/22, 12:59 PM - Amritansh: I am interests
9/28/22, 1:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yay
9/28/22, 1:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: Great
9/28/22, 1:00 PM - Ryan: Hmm what is useful?

A lot of things taught to us by the school is useless in the daily life of a common man isn't it

Unless you actually use those teachings in your daily life

For a common man, many topics and subjects may be useless after they get their job

But for people like scientists, they have to continue studying, revising, using those teachings on a daily basis I think

I can be wrong tho
9/28/22, 1:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ryan is typing...
9/28/22, 1:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: yea that's the thing i probably won't use sanskrit or hindi grammar or notice writing format, or writing on paper after school
9/28/22, 1:01 PM - Ryan: Is waste truly waste?

Can I use waste for harm?

Is anything truly waste?
9/28/22, 1:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
9/28/22, 1:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: But some things require too much effort to be converted into not waste, not useless
9/28/22, 1:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: So we don't bother
9/28/22, 1:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: One man's garbage is another man's treasure ig
9/28/22, 1:02 PM - Ryan: Nice
9/28/22, 1:03 PM - Ryan: Are exams really good?

Do they actually test your academic skills?
9/28/22, 1:04 PM - Ryan: You just spend a lot of time memorizing due to stress

And can't study other topics of interests
9/28/22, 1:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
9/28/22, 1:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: Exactly
9/28/22, 1:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: Most of the time they are not
9/28/22, 1:04 PM - Ryan: Ok
9/28/22, 1:05 PM - Ryan: Why being a topper is useless?
9/28/22, 1:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: eats up time
9/28/22, 1:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: doesn't help in life
9/28/22, 1:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: it might
9/28/22, 1:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: who knows
9/28/22, 1:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: i don't know
9/28/22, 1:07 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 from experience?
9/28/22, 1:07 PM - Ryan: But you are a topper
9/28/22, 1:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: no because ive never got good in hindi sanskrit or English, others have
9/28/22, 1:08 PM - Ryan: It depends on overall marks I think
9/28/22, 1:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: but no one checks or remembers their overall marks

just enjoy life and study 1 day before exam, jo hoga wo hoga

i won't remember my marks in a week, so who cares

what's important is that we understand it
9/28/22, 1:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: in conclusion: don't study
9/28/22, 1:11 PM - Ryan: Or do we
9/28/22, 1:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: i don't
9/28/22, 1:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: i don't know why vsauce is referring to himself in plural
9/28/22, 1:12 PM - Ryan: If you have properly understood it

Why do you need to study then

Why do you need to revise

Memory?
9/28/22, 1:12 PM - Anant Tiwari: you don't need to
9/28/22, 1:12 PM - Anant Tiwari: but understanding takes time
9/28/22, 1:12 PM - Anant Tiwari: we don't understand everything
9/28/22, 1:12 PM - Anant Tiwari: so we resort to ratta at the end so we get a little less scolding
9/28/22, 1:13 PM - Ryan: Yes
9/28/22, 1:13 PM - Ryan: Then why are toppers given appreciation because of ratta

Isn't ratta useless?
9/28/22, 1:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: it is
9/28/22, 1:14 PM - Ryan: Then why

Why appreciation
9/28/22, 1:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: people dont?
9/28/22, 1:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: why should i care someone got good marks
9/28/22, 1:14 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
9/28/22, 1:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: if they're a friend then thats cool, good job by them
9/28/22, 1:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
9/28/22, 1:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: name 1 person who cares
9/28/22, 1:14 PM - Ryan: Students don't

Teachers do

Parents do
9/28/22, 1:15 PM - Ryan: But it doesn't matter

It is just a temporary false glory
9/28/22, 1:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: and why should we care that others care
9/28/22, 1:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: exactly
9/28/22, 1:15 PM - Ryan: The superiority

The false superiority is fun

Superiority in everything

Study and physique
9/28/22, 1:15 PM - Ryan: But why can't we achieve them both
9/28/22, 1:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: what?
9/28/22, 1:16 PM - Ryan: Or can we
9/28/22, 1:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: both what
9/28/22, 1:16 PM - Ryan: May we just need to make people inferior
9/28/22, 1:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: no we don't
9/28/22, 1:16 PM - Ryan: Perfection

In intelligence as well as strength
9/28/22, 1:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: i mean, id say you have done that
9/28/22, 1:17 PM - Ryan: Yes we don't

Need is a complex word
9/28/22, 1:17 PM - Ryan: Downfall for humanity

With some temporary pride
9/28/22, 1:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: but why would we get pride by hurting others
9/28/22, 1:18 PM - Ryan: No

I still don't know everything

I am getting weaker
9/28/22, 1:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: you can improve
9/28/22, 1:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: everyone can if they want to
9/28/22, 1:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: but not many want to
9/28/22, 1:18 PM - Ryan: Dominance

Nature has always been like that

But aren't we a little advanced to go by the rules of nature
9/28/22, 1:18 PM - Ryan: But we are already dominated by nature

Our human nature
9/28/22, 1:18 PM - Ryan: Making us animal-like

Inferior
9/28/22, 1:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes, we don't need to do the torture we do right now to animals to achieve the comfort we have right now
9/28/22, 1:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: i mean yesterday for the first time in history any species to have ever existed on earth successfully shot an asteroid
9/28/22, 1:19 PM - Ryan: Not only to animals

We torture humans too

Or would I say, sacrifice?
9/28/22, 1:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
9/28/22, 1:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: we do
9/28/22, 1:20 PM - Ryan: Or do we?
9/28/22, 1:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: with more developments we can send more powerful weapons

with better calculations we can get better trajectories for higher impact velocities

Probably in the next few decades we will be able to avert dinosaur-extinction-level asteroids

A few decades is nothing for nature

So we are advanced
Too advanced
Too advanced to torture
9/28/22, 1:21 PM - Ryan: It may be a sad truth

But for us to live comfortably, something would need to compromise
9/28/22, 1:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
9/28/22, 1:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: but we can reduce those compromises
9/28/22, 1:22 PM - Ryan: Yes probably
9/28/22, 1:22 PM - Ryan: But do we want too?
9/28/22, 1:22 PM - Tanmaya: Arrival
9/28/22, 1:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
9/28/22, 1:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: Because people are stupid
9/28/22, 1:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: Helloo
9/28/22, 1:22 PM - Tanmaya: Got hindi paper today
9/28/22, 1:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: Nice
9/28/22, 1:22 PM - Ryan: I wouldn't say stupidity

Laziness rather
9/28/22, 1:23 PM - Ryan: What happened today?
9/28/22, 1:23 PM - Tanmaya: Nothing except marks showing and trials
9/28/22, 1:23 PM - Tanmaya: Hi
9/28/22, 1:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: Laziness is a form of stupidity, no?
9/28/22, 1:23 PM - Ryan: In how many subjects
9/28/22, 1:23 PM - Tanmaya: Hindi
9/28/22, 1:23 PM - Tanmaya: Only
9/28/22, 1:23 PM - Ryan: I don't know
9/28/22, 1:24 PM - Ryan: How many marks did you get?
9/28/22, 1:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: full
9/28/22, 1:24 PM - Tanmaya: NO
9/28/22, 1:24 PM - Ryan: Nice
9/28/22, 1:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: You deleted this message
9/28/22, 1:24 PM - Tanmaya: 76
9/28/22, 1:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: Amazing
9/28/22, 1:24 PM - Ryan: Nice
9/28/22, 1:25 PM - Ryan: Who got the highest marks

Tanmaya?Dev?Anant?Darash?Siddharth?
9/28/22, 1:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: NOT ME
9/28/22, 1:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: I GOT 4 WORD MEANINGS WRONG LITERALLY
9/28/22, 1:25 PM - Tanmaya: You
9/28/22, 1:25 PM - Ryan: You get full marks every time
9/28/22, 1:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: chup
9/28/22, 1:25 PM - Ryan: No I didn't

Stop lying
ü•≤
9/28/22, 1:26 PM - Ryan: Seriously, who was it?
9/28/22, 1:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: i don't think mam announce karengi
9/28/22, 1:26 PM - Tanmaya: Bro you got 80
9/28/22, 1:26 PM - Tanmaya: Ma'am ne kiya tha
9/28/22, 1:26 PM - Tanmaya: Sab ka
9/28/22, 1:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: ah
9/28/22, 1:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: do you remember mine
9/28/22, 1:26 PM - Navya: @917838968821 u got 76
9/28/22, 1:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: 65
9/28/22, 1:26 PM - Ryan: Ok

Better luck next time I guess
9/28/22, 1:26 PM - Navya: @919717944490 you got 80
9/28/22, 1:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: You deleted this message
9/28/22, 1:27 PM - Ryan: Wait what
9/28/22, 1:27 PM - Navya: not lying
9/28/22, 1:27 PM - Navya: or 74
idk
9/28/22, 1:27 PM - Ryan: Don't go lower

Don't disappoint him please
9/28/22, 1:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: mam ne daya kar ke de diya hoga

because i do not deserve 76 in hindi

mam said she'll cut for spelling mistake so she probably didn't cut for us for some reason
9/28/22, 1:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: that's still much better than what i was expecting so yay
9/28/22, 1:28 PM - Ryan: I bet others got good marks too
9/28/22, 1:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: but yes flying chappal attack
9/28/22, 1:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: hone waala hai aaj
9/28/22, 1:28 PM - Navya: I got..
9/28/22, 1:28 PM - Navya: ummm very bad.

9/28/22, 1:29 PM - Dev: Ryan got 80 out of 80

9/28/22, 1:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: no

How can you modify humans?
9/29/22, 8:47 AM - Ryan: Biologically
9/29/22, 9:21 AM - Ryan: Hmm biology is weird and complex

Science as a whole is wierd and complex
9/29/22, 9:21 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: we did it boys
9/29/22, 9:21 AM - Aditya Vardhan: What

9/29/22, 10:00 AM - Aditya Vardhan: So
9/29/22, 10:00 AM - Aditya Vardhan: You cant create a new human
9/29/22, 10:01 AM - Aditya Vardhan: Because it requires SOUL
9/29/22, 10:01 AM - Aditya Vardhan: but you can modify an existing human
9/29/22, 10:01 AM - Aditya Vardhan: Yes
9/29/22, 10:09 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: ctrl c ctrl v
9/29/22, 10:14 AM - Aditya Vardhan: No

9/29/22, 10:17 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: before birth or while they're living
9/29/22, 10:18 AM - Ryan: What is a SOUL
9/29/22, 10:18 AM - Ryan: Both
9/29/22, 10:18 AM - Ryan: üò∂
9/29/22, 10:18 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: also isn't china breeding genetically modified soldiefs
9/29/22, 10:18 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: hmm
9/29/22, 10:19 AM - Ryan: Breeding?
9/29/22, 10:19 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: yeah like modifying them before they're born
9/29/22, 10:20 AM - Ryan: Hmm
9/29/22, 10:20 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: and some people are modifying animals
9/29/22, 10:20 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: for eg cows, they're making the meat even thicker and denser
9/29/22, 10:21 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: for sales purpose
9/29/22, 10:21 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: ig
9/29/22, 10:21 AM - Ryan: Hmm
9/29/22, 10:28 AM - Aditya Vardhan: And some are making meat without killing animals
9/29/22, 10:28 AM - Aditya Vardhan: The vegitarian meat
9/29/22, 10:29 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: haaa yeab
9/29/22, 10:50 AM - Anant Tiwari: yea that's called selective breeding and we've done it for probably more than 10,000 years
9/29/22, 10:51 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: oh wow
9/29/22, 10:51 AM - Anant Tiwari: yes, it's not that safe as of now
9/29/22, 10:53 AM - Anant Tiwari: 4 of us r here
9/29/22, 10:54 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: yesss
9/29/22, 11:10 AM - Ryan: It seems wierd
9/29/22, 11:11 AM - Ryan: Breeding genetically modified soldiers?

I can't understand it
9/29/22, 11:13 AM - Ryan: Aren't they using performance enhancement drugs

For better,more powerful soldiers
9/29/22, 11:13 AM - Ryan: ?
9/29/22, 11:13 AM - Anant Tiwari: genetically modify babies and train them to be soldiers as they grow up
9/29/22, 11:13 AM - Anant Tiwari: yes, world war 2
9/29/22, 11:14 AM - Anant Tiwari: it was breaking bad except slightly more people died also they had planes
9/29/22, 11:15 AM - Anant Tiwari: also mid-air collisions fairly common too

so drugged soldiers fighting in metal boxes hitting each other
9/29/22, 11:16 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: yes better soldiers
9/29/22, 11:17 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: evil
9/29/22, 11:17 AM - Anant Tiwari: unsustainable too
9/29/22, 11:18 AM - Anant Tiwari: strategy usually matter more than physical power

more physical power you have , but now cant think properly plus drugs side effects plus these guys get addicted and then they're not that useful in war until you keep overdosing them again and again and eventually health deteriorate and they die
9/29/22, 11:18 AM - Anant Tiwari: only useful in short term conflicts
9/29/22, 11:19 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: point
9/29/22, 11:24 AM - Ryan: Hmm wait...shouldn't this be illegal

Well China it is
9/29/22, 11:27 AM - Ryan: @917838968821 Can you grow too competitive?
9/29/22, 11:27 AM - Anant Tiwari: Exactly

9/29/22, 11:30 AM - Anant Tiwari: there are going to be so many kids they'll only tally a few times a day
9/29/22, 11:31 AM - Anant Tiwari: you could have wandered much further from that since then
9/29/22, 11:31 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: because if the children lose it then teachers pe blame jaayega that they did not supervise the children
9/29/22, 11:31 AM - Anant Tiwari: so the option is to be trapped with other kids, stay close together

but itna formation type ka lagega it won't be much of a trip

9/29/22, 7:52 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: he literally has?
9/29/22, 7:52 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: or not
9/29/22, 7:53 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: maybe mam took name of people who are good in science
9/29/22, 7:53 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: in our class
9/29/22, 7:53 PM - Ryan: Good in science?

Are we?
9/29/22, 7:53 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: you are
9/29/22, 7:53 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: anant is
9/29/22, 7:53 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: and the names which were given
9/29/22, 7:53 PM - Ryan: No
9/29/22, 7:54 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: you know more than everyone in our class
9/29/22, 7:54 PM - Ryan: Science is vast

What we are taught is just basics

I am not good in science

I never was
9/29/22, 7:54 PM - Ryan: Lie that is
9/29/22, 7:54 PM - Navya: @919717944490 is von safe?
9/29/22, 7:54 PM - Navya: vpn*
9/29/22, 7:55 PM - Ryan: Yes?

Also your VPN has to be strong I think
9/29/22, 7:55 PM - Ryan: Anant is smarter

Ask his opinion
9/29/22, 7:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
9/29/22, 7:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: Mam suggest kar rahi hai
9/29/22, 8:00 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yea
9/29/22, 8:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: YES THEY AFE SAFE BUT NOT USEFUL
9/29/22, 8:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: DON'T FALL FOR MARKETING
9/29/22, 8:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: pls
9/29/22, 8:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: A VPN won't make you more secure
9/29/22, 8:00 PM - Navya: arre
9/29/22, 8:00 PM - Siddharth: yes
9/29/22, 8:00 PM - Navya: whenever I open ultra data saver
9/29/22, 8:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: Sure I mean if you're planning a murder VPN is the BARE Minimum

but its not useful in general usage
9/29/22, 8:00 PM - Ryan: Depends on VPN maybe?

Most are garbage?
9/29/22, 8:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
9/29/22, 8:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: Almost all of them
9/29/22, 8:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: They maintain logs
9/29/22, 8:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: They claim to not
9/29/22, 8:00 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: this video was sponsored by Nord VPN
9/29/22, 8:00 PM - Navya: it says "VPN IS ACTIVATED BY SAMSUNG MAX" @917838968821
9/29/22, 8:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: If they don't maintain logs, the government will ban them immediately
9/29/22, 8:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: Then don't enable this stupid ultra data saver made because you should not use random VPNs even if your phone has built in one
9/29/22, 8:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: A VPN simply changes the fact that instead of your ISP, the VPN company can see which site you open
9/29/22, 8:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: Not even which web page. Just which site. Idk man but I can't care much if Hathaway knows that I used youtube.com at 4 PM
9/29/22, 8:02 PM - Navya: abe 100% ho jayega toh issue ho jayegi
9/29/22, 8:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: Kya ho jayega
9/29/22, 8:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: 100%?
9/29/22, 8:02 PM - Navya: net
9/29/22, 8:02 PM - Navya: I wont be able to watch anything
9/29/22, 8:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: Are you sure the ultra data saver mode actually works

Have you gone into youtube settings and changed default video quality?
9/29/22, 8:03 PM - Navya: yes
9/29/22, 8:03 PM - Dev: Iangine going on a train at 4:30
9/29/22, 8:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: I doubt it changes that. Placebo effect

unless maybe it does actually save data, but I don't think it helps much. Plus it enables a VPN and unnecessarily doing that is not very poggers
9/29/22, 8:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: Wow
9/29/22, 8:03 PM - Navya: ok
9/29/22, 8:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: Okay I guess
9/29/22, 8:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: then if it saves data, go ahead use it
9/29/22, 8:03 PM - Dev: VPN se jayada kuch nhai hota
9/29/22, 8:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: but don't install random VPNs from playstore
9/29/22, 8:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: exactly
9/29/22, 8:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: they're very useless
9/29/22, 8:03 PM - Dev: Like you have to just browse the internet safe
9/29/22, 8:03 PM - Navya: MAINE BAND KAR DIA
9/29/22, 8:03 PM - Navya: KUSH?
9/29/22, 8:03 PM - Dev: And don't downlaod this type of shit

9/29/22, 8:44 PM - Navya: in studies
9/29/22, 8:45 PM - Navya: I literally got 32.5
9/29/22, 8:45 PM - Navya: I was very happy that I passed
9/29/22, 8:45 PM - Tanmaya: It's okay there is always a second chance
9/29/22, 8:45 PM - Tanmaya: You will give 2xbest next time
9/29/22, 8:46 PM - Tanmaya: But you will need to do hard work
9/29/22, 8:46 PM - Navya: yes
9/29/22, 8:46 PM - Navya: doing that only
9/29/22, 8:46 PM - Navya: I will go according to planner and study everything
9/29/22, 8:46 PM - Navya: üòÉ
9/29/22, 8:46 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: are you going to remember your 8th ke marks when  you grow up?
9/29/22, 8:46 PM - Navya: yes.
9/29/22, 8:46 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: do you remember 4th ke marks?
9/29/22, 8:46 PM - Navya: yes
9/29/22, 8:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: statue of liberty
9/29/22, 8:47 PM - Navya: I was a topper student in my old school
9/29/22, 8:47 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: you idiot this was supposed to be motivational, you were supposed to say "no"
9/29/22, 8:47 PM - Navya: it means I am not good at studies and I need to fo hardwork
9/29/22, 8:47 PM - Tanmaya: LoL ü§£
9/29/22, 8:47 PM - Navya: I know
9/29/22, 8:47 PM - Tanmaya: No one. Remembers 8th marks
9/29/22, 8:47 PM - Tanmaya: But
9/29/22, 8:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: tell me, i am curious
9/29/22, 8:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: because you don't
9/29/22, 8:47 PM - Navya: I do
9/29/22, 8:47 PM - Navya: I do
9/29/22, 8:47 PM - Tanmaya: 8th is the base for studying for upper classs
9/29/22, 8:47 PM - Navya: ask a subject
9/29/22, 8:47 PM - Navya: yes.
9/29/22, 8:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: okay tell me 4th ut-1 science
9/29/22, 8:47 PM - Navya: and when my base is kharab
9/29/22, 8:47 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: she's gonna say a random number and part of us is gonna believe her
9/29/22, 8:47 PM - Navya: I cant do anything
9/29/22, 8:48 PM - Tanmaya: practice ask doubts to ma'am ! Ma'am will help you
9/29/22, 8:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: exactly

but i don't care if she remembers it or not.

i care if she's being honest with herself

because if she does make up aa number, she'll internally realise that she is doing that and that's probably not amazing
9/29/22, 8:48 PM - Navya: it used to happen in 30 Mark's I was never really good in maths I used to get above 25 I got 28 or something
9/29/22, 8:48 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: true
9/29/22, 8:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes that's not called remembering your marks
9/29/22, 8:48 PM - Navya: chup
9/29/22, 8:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: üòÉ
9/29/22, 8:49 PM - Navya: I mean soya chap
9/29/22, 8:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: i mean
9/29/22, 8:49 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ‚úÖ
9/29/22, 8:49 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: no way you guys typed "I mean"
9/29/22, 8:49 PM - Tanmaya: Chup ho jao please I am eating dal roti üò≠
9/29/22, 8:49 PM - Navya: y do i feel like i am the most nalayak person
9/29/22, 8:49 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: you're probably just demotivated
9/29/22, 8:49 PM - Navya: my mom used to top in her school , college and uni
9/29/22, 8:50 PM - Navya: and she was good in every subject
9/29/22, 8:50 PM - Navya: and she always used to get 100/100
9/29/22, 8:50 PM - Navya: her teachers still remember her.
9/29/22, 8:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: do they really?
9/29/22, 8:50 PM - Navya: no teacher will remember me except my 3rd grade ct
9/29/22, 8:50 PM - Navya: yes they do.
9/29/22, 8:51 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: everyone has their own pace for their own success

just because someone does not achieve full marks in a particular subject, it does not mean that they are a failure or don't know anything

maybe you'll do even better in the future?
I'm not saying that you're not doing good now

you're doing your best like the other
9/29/22, 8:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: so how do you know that

my mom used to study a lot and get first in a lot of things

i don't think her teachers still cared enough about her to remember her after 20-30 years
9/29/22, 8:51 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: s
9/29/22, 8:51 PM - Navya: and even like so called bhabhi which I dont consider as bhabhi I am very sorry about that.
she is the daughter of my moms physics or idk geo teacher
9/29/22, 8:51 PM - Navya: her maths teacher remembers her too
9/29/22, 8:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes

maths we don't have to study later in lide
9/29/22, 8:51 PM - Tanmaya: Navya remember
9/29/22, 8:51 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ‚úÖ

9/29/22, 8:51 PM - Tanmaya: Marks is just a piece of paper that doesn't define youre future
9/29/22, 8:52 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: TOILET PAPER
9/29/22, 8:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: we don't have to study science or computer

we don't have to study ssc or hindi or sanskrit or English

9/29/22, 9:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: I was literally reading it today only
9/29/22, 9:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: After so long
9/29/22, 9:36 PM - Navya: ryan u going to trip tommorow?
9/29/22, 9:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: he is
9/29/22, 9:36 PM - Ryan: How is coal tar used in drugs and explosives?

(If it is used)
9/29/22, 9:36 PM - Navya: I am reading it right now
9/29/22, 9:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: HAHAA
9/29/22, 9:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: apparently nowadays for medicines not much used
9/29/22, 9:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: kinda kills things

9/29/22, 9:37 PM - Ryan: Hmm

Howüò∂

In what ways
9/29/22, 9:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: arson
9/29/22, 9:37 PM - Ryan: How can effectively use it
9/29/22, 9:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: arson
9/29/22, 9:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: i don't know man apne upar daal do
9/29/22, 9:37 PM - Navya: <Media omitted>
9/29/22, 9:37 PM - Navya: üòÉ
9/29/22, 9:37 PM - Ryan: Ok
9/29/22, 9:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: or thanks to chemistry read structure and figure out reactions with skin cells and figure out why you'll die
9/29/22, 9:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: i guess that's one way
9/29/22, 9:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: commit arson on your eyes so that everything you see for the last 10 seconds of your vision, you will see destruction everywhere
9/29/22, 9:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: Or commit arson everywhere
9/29/22, 9:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: üò®‚úÖ‚úÖ
9/29/22, 9:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: even better idea
9/29/22, 9:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: @919717944490 you shall sleep
9/29/22, 9:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: Goodnight ryan
9/29/22, 9:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: <Media omitted>
9/29/22, 9:39 PM - Ryan: Yes you need more

80 in all
9/29/22, 9:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: ‚úÖ
9/29/22, 9:39 PM - Ryan: 100 percent in all
9/29/22, 9:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: but i don't try to
9/29/22, 9:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: because thog lazy
9/29/22, 9:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: thog dont knoow
9/29/22, 9:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: thog dont caare
9/29/22, 9:39 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: do we really tho
9/29/22, 9:39 PM - Ryan: No

Get otherwise no pizza for you
9/29/22, 9:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: ideally accha hoga

but its a waste of time IMO

sanskrit is not useful for me
9/29/22, 9:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: :((((
9/29/22, 9:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ok I will try harder
9/29/22, 9:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: My best next time
9/29/22, 9:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: üò® NOOOO
9/29/22, 9:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: true
9/29/22, 9:40 PM - Navya: will we get workbook in 9th too?
9/29/22, 9:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: when will French help you
9/29/22, 9:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: probably not
9/29/22, 9:40 PM - Navya: @919999373163 @917838968821
9/29/22, 9:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: as workbooks proved out to be very useless
9/29/22, 9:40 PM - Navya: wut why
9/29/22, 9:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: when I commit war crimes in france
9/29/22, 9:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: or maybe they weren't
9/29/22, 9:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: but so many errors in workbooks
9/29/22, 9:40 PM - Navya: I think science ke milenge
9/29/22, 9:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: its a big headache
9/29/22, 9:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: I mean, extra language aani chaiye
9/29/22, 9:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: yea that's true
9/29/22, 9:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: science many ques from workbook
9/29/22, 9:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yeaa
9/29/22, 9:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: but still many things in workbook are wrong
9/29/22, 9:41 PM - Ryan: Une baguette s'il vous plait monsieur
9/29/22, 9:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: we should convince teachers to not use them next year
9/29/22, 9:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: a baguette please sir
9/29/22, 9:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: i mean
9/29/22, 9:41 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: Non
9/29/22, 9:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: Great now we know how to order baguette at a french restaurant
9/29/22, 9:41 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: "sir this is a mechanical store"
9/29/22, 9:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: Not that useful in our lives
9/29/22, 9:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: LMAO
9/29/22, 9:41 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ‚úÖ
9/29/22, 9:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: reminds me of
9/29/22, 9:41 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: "we don't speak french"
9/29/22, 9:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: the man who lived in petushkee
9/29/22, 9:41 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: HAHAHA
9/29/22, 9:41 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: DUMB FUCK
9/29/22, 9:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: Exactly
9/29/22, 9:42 PM - Ryan: No

He was smart
9/29/22, 9:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: Saucepan on head
9/29/22, 9:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: Are you sure
9/29/22, 9:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: well perhaps
9/29/22, 9:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: the rest of the poem may point toward him being smart
9/29/22, 9:42 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: he was a bit too confsued
9/29/22, 9:42 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: on how things work
9/29/22, 9:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: but according to the extract we read, he was pretty muddle-headed
9/29/22, 9:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: perhaps it is my fault
9/29/22, 9:42 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yeahh
9/29/22, 9:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: for not reading the entire poem
9/29/22, 9:42 PM - Ryan: That was strategy

For security, the protection a simple hat couldn't give

He was indeed smart
9/29/22, 9:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: i should go
9/29/22, 9:42 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: lmaooo
9/29/22, 9:42 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: it is true tho
9/29/22, 9:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: Shoot his toes
9/29/22, 9:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: Easy
9/29/22, 9:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: I have outdone the man who lived in Petushkee
9/29/22, 9:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: No more mittens?
9/29/22, 9:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: Mittens are not good armour
9/29/22, 9:43 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: I don't think the saucepan handle has enough balance to stay on his head
9/29/22, 9:43 PM - Ryan: Thats why he wore those mittens there
9/29/22, 9:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: Mittens are not good armour
9/29/22, 9:43 PM - Ryan: Extra soft,cushioned

Perfect
9/29/22, 9:43 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: kitten armour
9/29/22, 9:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: 1) Ryan
2) Samarth
9/29/22, 9:43 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: mirren srojdn
9/29/22, 9:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: NO WAAY GUYS
9/29/22, 9:43 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: mitren sorund
9/29/22, 9:43 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: mirrern sround
9/29/22, 9:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: i used to think that
9/29/22, 9:43 PM - Ryan: Yes

Definitely not enough for a bullet
9/29/22, 9:43 PM - Ryan: But it is his strategy
9/29/22, 9:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: A stupid strategy
9/29/22, 9:44 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
9/29/22, 9:44 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: mitten momentum
9/29/22, 9:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
9/29/22, 9:44 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: go fast with mittens
9/29/22, 9:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: yay
9/29/22, 9:44 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: slide on floors
9/29/22, 9:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: some amount of momentum
9/29/22, 9:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: friction
9/29/22, 9:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: :(
9/29/22, 9:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: sliding friction
9/29/22, 9:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: not poggers
9/29/22, 9:44 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: unfortunately friction üôÅ
9/29/22, 9:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: no more momentum?
9/29/22, 9:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes sir
9/29/22, 9:44 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: üò≠
9/29/22, 9:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: or wait
9/29/22, 9:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: momentum needn't be m√óv
9/29/22, 9:44 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: can we ignore friction
9/29/22, 9:44 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: are you retarded
9/29/22, 9:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: hypothetically, nuclear fusion

calculate momentum for the energy
9/29/22, 9:45 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: what the fuck is needn't and mayn'y
9/29/22, 9:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: mayn't
9/29/22, 9:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: English grammar book
9/29/22, 9:45 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: mayonaise
9/29/22, 9:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yessur
9/29/22, 9:45 PM - Ryan: And also

Mittens were the perfect for toes

He was among the genius humans who realized that the human hand needs more flexibility for the fingers for better functionality, but due to the mittens design, it can't provide that

So he wore them on this toes

Toes are only required for balance

Perfecr
9/29/22, 9:45 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: pefecrr
9/29/22, 9:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: Are you sure toes are only required for balance
9/29/22, 9:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: Are you sure
9/29/22, 9:45 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: üò® checkmate?!?!?!?!??!
9/29/22, 9:45 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: NANI
9/29/22, 9:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: O mai wama shinderu
9/29/22, 9:46 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: nani?
9/29/22, 9:46 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: *lazerbeam*
9/29/22, 9:46 PM - Ryan: For other purposes, you can use your hands
9/29/22, 9:46 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: mammal
9/29/22, 9:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: Japanese equivalent to guh
9/29/22, 9:46 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: hahahha
9/29/22, 9:46 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yeah
9/29/22, 9:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
9/29/22, 9:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: Or can you
9/29/22, 9:46 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: like, using hands to walk?
9/29/22, 9:46 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: what
9/29/22, 9:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
9/29/22, 9:46 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: or using both?
9/29/22, 9:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: Why don't you cut your toess
9/29/22, 9:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: üòÉ
9/29/22, 9:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: I mean
9/29/22, 9:47 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: how much can i sell each for
9/29/22, 9:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: The man who lived in Petushkee had a strategy
9/29/22, 9:47 PM - Ryan: Unable to walk, run etc
9/29/22, 9:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: But it was stupid
9/29/22, 9:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: Are you sure
9/29/22, 9:47 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: "what does the poet mean by "muddle headed"?"

I wrote mentally retarded
9/29/22, 9:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yay
9/29/22, 9:48 PM - Ryan: Yes, unable to walk,run etc properly

Unless I go teke-teke
9/29/22, 9:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: Properly does not matter
9/29/22, 9:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: thog dont caare
9/29/22, 9:48 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: anant using ryans strategy on ryan himself
9/29/22, 9:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: You can walk
9/29/22, 9:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: You can hop
9/29/22, 9:48 PM - Ryan: Have you tried
9/29/22, 9:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
9/29/22, 9:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: I do not have toes
9/29/22, 9:48 PM - Ryan: Or can you?

How many times
9/29/22, 9:48 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: scary japan
9/29/22, 9:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: A few times
9/29/22, 9:48 PM - Ryan: Who took them
9/29/22, 9:48 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: Crawl bro
9/29/22, 9:48 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: easy
9/29/22, 9:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: My friend
9/29/22, 9:48 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: use a wheelchair for faster momentum
9/29/22, 9:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: @918929020721 Please give me my toes back
9/29/22, 9:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: I will literally end you if you say "faster momentum"
9/29/22, 9:49 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: he's experimenting with them
9/29/22, 9:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: Do not use that word with momentum
9/29/22, 9:49 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: but
9/29/22, 9:49 PM - Ryan: Less speed, less efficient
9/29/22, 9:49 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: wheelchair
9/29/22, 9:49 PM - Ryan: Rough road
9/29/22, 9:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: Are you sure
9/29/22, 9:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: wear sandals but for the body
9/29/22, 9:49 PM - Ryan: Yes
9/29/22, 9:49 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: HEWEHWLL CHARIRI
9/29/22, 9:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ok buddy
9/29/22, 9:50 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: lmao
9/29/22, 9:50 PM - Ryan: Unless wheels
9/29/22, 9:50 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i literally said that
9/29/22, 9:50 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: 5 times
9/29/22, 9:50 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: wheel chair
9/29/22, 9:50 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: wheel chair
9/29/22, 9:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: People have crawled at 1.8m/s in 100m runs
9/29/22, 9:50 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: remote control for more efficiency in direction
9/29/22, 9:50 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: it requires practice and stamina
9/29/22, 9:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: Races, crawls, Craces? Braces?
9/29/22, 9:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: Do I care?
9/29/22, 9:50 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: brawls
9/29/22, 9:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
9/29/22, 9:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: Good
9/29/22, 9:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: Brawly

9/29/22, 9:51 PM - Ryan: Must need very smooth surface
9/29/22, 9:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: ...
9/29/22, 9:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: Wheels
9/29/22, 9:51 PM - Ryan: That is illegal
9/29/22, 9:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: Crawl with wheels
9/29/22, 9:51 PM - Ryan: Or is it
9/29/22, 9:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: Or is it?
9/29/22, 9:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: Stop
9/29/22, 9:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: <Media omitted>
9/29/22, 9:52 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: Welcome to another episode of does anant care!

On todays episode we have people practicing for a crawl race

Now for the real question, does anant care?!?!?


No

We will come back with another episode after this short 4 day ad break

"please download YouTube vanced"
9/29/22, 9:52 PM - Ryan: Why crawl?

Wheel with engine
9/29/22, 9:52 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: LMAO
9/29/22, 9:52 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: hahahaha
9/29/22, 9:52 PM - Ryan: Revanced?

Or is it
9/29/22, 9:52 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: what if malfunction
9/29/22, 9:52 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: btoh
9/29/22, 9:52 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: oth
9/29/22, 9:52 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: noth
9/29/22, 9:52 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: noth
9/29/22, 9:53 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: noth
9/29/22, 9:53 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: noth
9/29/22, 9:53 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: both
9/29/22, 9:53 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: what if engine go bobm
9/29/22, 9:53 PM - Ryan: How would you imagine a biological structure with wheel like-limbs

Can you imagine that
9/29/22, 9:53 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: I already am
9/29/22, 9:53 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: transformers!
9/29/22, 9:54 PM - Ryan: The skin tissue constantly tightening I think due to the rotation?

Stopped blood flow
9/29/22, 9:54 PM - Ryan: Well Anant is smarter

We need his opinion
9/29/22, 9:54 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: does that lead to death?
9/29/22, 9:54 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: you both are
9/29/22, 9:54 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: why not use brain
9/29/22, 9:54 PM - Ryan: No
9/29/22, 9:54 PM - Ryan: He more smarter
9/29/22, 9:55 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
9/29/22, 9:55 PM - Ryan: He big brain

I smol brain
9/29/22, 9:55 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: also don't you think if we travel with wheels
9/29/22, 9:55 PM - Ryan: Well I think that would render that organ useless
9/29/22, 9:55 PM - Ryan: Or am I thinking it wrong
9/29/22, 9:55 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: wait first

how would you imagine a person with limb like wheels
9/29/22, 9:55 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: position I am talking about
9/29/22, 9:56 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: like animals?
9/29/22, 9:56 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: two limbs in the front

two limbs at the back
9/29/22, 9:56 PM - Ryan: And we need our present type of limbs for various purposes

For grabbing, writing, opening,closing,typing I think

In the animal kingdom, the wheels would only provide mobility

But would be useless for hunting maybe
9/29/22, 9:56 PM - Ryan: Or would they?
9/29/22, 9:57 PM - Ryan: Limbs aren't always necessary are they?
9/29/22, 9:57 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: depends on the speed
9/29/22, 9:57 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: sometimes yes sometimes no
9/29/22, 9:57 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: depends on the task
9/29/22, 9:57 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: you can't live without it
9/29/22, 9:57 PM - Dev: Jim
9/29/22, 9:57 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: we go
9/29/22, 9:57 PM - Dev: @919717944490 packing ho gaye?
9/29/22, 9:57 PM - Dev: Nhai bhai
9/29/22, 9:57 PM - Dev: Koi nhai jata
9/29/22, 9:57 PM - Dev: Na tu
9/29/22, 9:57 PM - Dev: Na mai
9/29/22, 9:58 PM - Ryan: No ü•≤
9/29/22, 9:58 PM - Dev: Lol
9/29/22, 9:58 PM - Dev: 5 hours left for trip
9/29/22, 9:58 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ryan please sleep
9/29/22, 9:58 PM - Dev: @919454835401 packing ho gaye
9/29/22, 9:58 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: wo so bhi gaya
9/29/22, 9:58 PM - Dev: Taking me so leyo
9/29/22, 9:58 PM - Ryan: I don't know why

But I am currently discussing about animals with wheels
9/29/22, 9:58 PM - Ryan: I should sleep
9/29/22, 9:58 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: not people?
9/29/22, 9:58 PM - Ryan: Or should I?
9/29/22, 9:58 PM - Dev: Train*
9/29/22, 9:58 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: no end the discussion
9/29/22, 9:59 PM - Dev: You should not
9/29/22, 9:59 PM - Ryan: Batmobile

Catmobile

What if they were real
9/29/22, 9:59 PM - Ryan: Can they be real?
9/29/22, 9:59 PM - Ryan: Should they be real?
9/29/22, 9:59 PM - Dev: Yes
9/29/22, 9:59 PM - Dev: Jo
9/29/22, 9:59 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: why would animals need wheels if they're already fast enough?

yes I'm talking about particular animals eg lions, jaguars, cheetas etc
9/29/22, 9:59 PM - Dev: No*
9/29/22, 9:59 PM - Dev: Kya need hai
9/29/22, 9:59 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: like
bats with wheels or the batmobile from movir
9/29/22, 10:00 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: exactly
9/29/22, 10:00 PM - Ryan: I don't know

More energy efficient maybe?

Anant is smarter

I need his opinion on this
9/29/22, 10:00 PM - Dev: Bhai Ryan Agar asj asta toh running me bhi slect ho jata
9/29/22, 10:00 PM - Dev: Monke speed
9/29/22, 10:00 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: NYOOOOOOOM
9/29/22, 10:00 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: true
9/29/22, 10:00 PM - Ryan: Vroom

What If I hade wheels
9/29/22, 10:00 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: you wouldn't need them
9/29/22, 10:00 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: you're already faster than the rest of us
9/29/22, 10:01 PM - Dev: Still faster on legs
9/29/22, 10:01 PM - Dev: True
9/29/22, 10:01 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: and you would become even faster
9/29/22, 10:01 PM - Dev: VOOOORM
9/29/22, 10:01 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ryanmobile lmao
9/29/22, 10:01 PM - Dev: Would need an engine for jt
9/29/22, 10:01 PM - Ryan: How would we actually gain acceleration
9/29/22, 10:01 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ryan go vroom vrrom
9/29/22, 10:01 PM - Dev: Practice
9/29/22, 10:01 PM - Dev: Get more stamina
9/29/22, 10:01 PM - Ryan: In a wheel and axle like system in our body
9/29/22, 10:01 PM - Ryan: Wait
9/29/22, 10:01 PM - Dev: This message was deleted
9/29/22, 10:01 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: maybe a button or an interface?
9/29/22, 10:01 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: that controls the speed of the wheels
9/29/22, 10:02 PM - Dev: Engine toh chaeeye hoga
9/29/22, 10:02 PM - Dev: Kaha se aaeega
9/29/22, 10:02 PM - Ryan: Buttons

In us humans
9/29/22, 10:02 PM - Ryan: Natural buttons?
9/29/22, 10:02 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: futuristic thought process
9/29/22, 10:02 PM - Dev: Or just pull one funger
9/29/22, 10:02 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: belly button lmao
9/29/22, 10:02 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: what if we pull too hard?
9/29/22, 10:02 PM - Dev: Breake
9/29/22, 10:02 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: bone toot
9/29/22, 10:03 PM - Dev: Monke speed

9/29/22, 10:07 PM - Dev: I donno
9/29/22, 10:07 PM - Ryan: Hmm sads get cooler/hotter faster than water right?
9/29/22, 10:08 PM - Dev: They already have one I think
9/29/22, 10:08 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: sponges?

water unme store hojaata im guessing?
9/29/22, 10:08 PM - Dev: Yes

9/29/22, 10:09 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: it's sometimes visible, sometimes not
9/29/22, 10:10 PM - Ryan: I think the the industries that gets energy from coal are some examples of thermal energy

We need Anants opinion

I am stupid and overconfident
9/29/22, 10:10 PM - Navya: I got the answer
9/29/22, 10:10 PM - Ryan: @917838968821

10/4/22, 1:50 PM - Ryan: I saw Octopus remains, and squid remains, and millipede and centipede dead bodies preserved

The museum was....

Except for the zoology part and the ores and chemicals part everything was pretty not interesting as we couldn't get enough time to properly read and understand what that thing is

Doggo painting too
10/4/22, 1:51 PM - Ryan: And I saw a white Buffalo I think(Albino Buffalo), a dead body of an animal on the roads, maybe a bull like creature's skeleton, a cow itching near its eye with its feet etc

10/4/22, 5:31 PM - Aditya Vardhan: there are chances
10/4/22, 5:31 PM - Aditya Vardhan: of dying permanently
10/4/22, 5:32 PM - Aditya Vardhan: whilst trying  to die tewmporarily
10/4/22, 5:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes ofcourse
10/4/22, 5:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: much higher chances of dying permanently in india atleast
10/4/22, 5:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: there are certain people who are not willing to learn CPR because it breaks bones
10/4/22, 5:32 PM - Aditya Vardhan: yes
10/4/22, 5:32 PM - Aditya Vardhan: rib
10/4/22, 5:32 PM - Aditya Vardhan: cage
10/4/22, 5:32 PM - Aditya Vardhan: creak*
10/4/22, 5:33 PM - Aditya Vardhan: ribs break
10/4/22, 5:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: no examples i shall provide for these people but this mentality is why people in india die earlier
10/4/22, 5:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: better than dying
10/4/22, 5:33 PM - Aditya Vardhan: deja vu
10/4/22, 5:33 PM - Aditya Vardhan: i think
10/4/22, 5:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: exactly
10/4/22, 5:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: i told you to go learn the basics of it
10/4/22, 5:33 PM - Aditya Vardhan: we have talked about this
10/4/22, 5:33 PM - Aditya Vardhan: i did not
10/4/22, 5:33 PM - Aditya Vardhan: i wont
10/4/22, 5:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: I've been in this place before higher on the beat when I know its the time
10/4/22, 5:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: why will you not
10/4/22, 5:33 PM - Aditya Vardhan: it breaks bones
10/4/22, 5:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: so you are willing to let a person die
10/4/22, 5:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: to not break ribcage
10/4/22, 5:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: logic üòÉ
10/4/22, 5:34 PM - Aditya Vardhan: yes
10/4/22, 5:34 PM - Aditya Vardhan: it dosent have a high surviaal rate
10/4/22, 5:34 PM - Aditya Vardhan: i am kind of dead
10/4/22, 5:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: and?
10/4/22, 5:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: 12%
10/4/22, 5:35 PM - Aditya Vardhan: literally 0 energy
10/4/22, 5:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: do you know why cardiac arrest doesn't
10/4/22, 5:35 PM - Aditya Vardhan: i dont know why cardiac arrest dosent
10/4/22, 5:36 PM - Aditya Vardhan: gg i play bedwars
10/4/22, 5:36 PM - Aditya Vardhan: i hav idea
10/4/22, 5:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: because of people like you who don't bother learning cpr

your survival rate literally triples if someone performs even crappy CPR

but most people don't bother spending those 5 minutes googling to triple the survival rate of something which a person you know will probably experience in their lifetime
10/4/22, 5:36 PM - Aditya Vardhan: i sleep
10/4/22, 5:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: it doesn't have high survival rate
10/4/22, 5:36 PM - Aditya Vardhan: rather than thinking all of this
10/4/22, 5:36 PM - Aditya Vardhan: sleep is better
10/4/22, 5:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: what if you have a cardiac arrest while sleeping
10/4/22, 5:37 PM - Aditya Vardhan: i will die
10/4/22, 5:37 PM - Aditya Vardhan: kind of peace
10/4/22, 5:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: or will it
10/4/22, 5:37 PM - Aditya Vardhan: huge pain

10/4/22, 5:38 PM - Aditya Vardhan: it cant
10/4/22, 5:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: the huge pain forever

honestly we can't know

so better to GOOGLE HOW TO DO CPR
10/4/22, 5:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: sure buddy

10/4/22, 8:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: And they even only eat a small part of themselves
10/4/22, 8:28 PM - Aditya Vardhan: People who bite there nails are self cannibal

10/4/22, 8:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: atleast you can bend and stuff to a decent degree without the pain

but those 69 year olds they usually have omnipresent back pain
10/4/22, 8:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: omnipresent is not the correct word
10/4/22, 8:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: chronic?

Really toxic
10/5/22, 1:14 PM - Ryan: And also, does Air resistance depend on size?
10/5/22, 1:14 PM - Ryan: Does air start to feel denser as you get smaller?
10/5/22, 1:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: what's funny about it

10/5/22, 1:57 PM - Ryan: How awful Is sodium cyanate
10/5/22, 1:57 PM - Ryan: Is hydrogen cyanide more toxic than sodium cyanide
10/5/22, 2:15 PM - Aditya Vardhan: You can step almost a day ahead
10/5/22, 2:15 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Diomede
10/5/22, 2:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: Low but if you're small, probably weaker too so the feeling depends

10/5/22, 2:20 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 How does friction keep a nail fixed to the wall
10/5/22, 2:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: asperities prevent each other from moving, as the interlocking is stronger than gravity
10/5/22, 2:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: than the force by gravity at a point
10/5/22, 2:22 PM - Ryan: Ok

10/5/22, 2:25 PM - Ryan: Kamikaze?
10/5/22, 2:25 PM - Aditya Vardhan: They could have just jumped outside the pit
10/5/22, 2:25 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Why
10/5/22, 2:26 PM - Ryan: The pit?
10/5/22, 2:26 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Also
10/5/22, 2:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: ha buddy they'll jump out of a plane moving at 700kmph, they'll deploy a parachute and surely no one would shoot them, surely they won't hit the wing, surely they won't land in the water and then get captured by the enemy and then tortured
10/5/22, 2:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: what pit
10/5/22, 2:26 PM - Aditya Vardhan: They knew that they were going to die
10/5/22, 2:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: middle of the ocean me kaha pit hai

10/5/22, 2:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: ?????????
10/5/22, 2:27 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Helmets
10/5/22, 2:27 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Why need helmet
10/5/22, 2:27 PM - Aditya Vardhan: You will die
10/5/22, 2:27 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Why need basic accesories
10/5/22, 2:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: you don't want to die before you hit the target
10/5/22, 2:27 PM - Aditya Vardhan: You are going to die
10/5/22, 2:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: they'll shoot your plane
10/5/22, 2:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: you want to perform maneuver
10/5/22, 2:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: no helmet = bonk = unconscious = no aim and you crash in water
10/5/22, 2:28 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Yes
10/5/22, 2:28 PM - Aditya Vardhan: They used trained people
10/5/22, 2:28 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Right?
10/5/22, 2:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: they were very smart bro, they did it for a reason, they just underestimated how much stronger US soldiers were
10/5/22, 2:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
10/5/22, 2:28 PM - Aditya Vardhan: A normal person can't operate a plane
10/5/22, 2:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: or can they?
10/5/22, 2:28 PM - Aditya Vardhan: That's such a huge waste
10/5/22, 2:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: bhai
10/5/22, 2:29 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Yes
10/5/22, 2:29 PM - Aditya Vardhan: I know

10/5/22, 2:29 PM - Aditya Vardhan: But
10/5/22, 2:29 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Knowing that you are going to die is weird
10/5/22, 2:29 PM - Ryan: Why
10/5/22, 2:30 PM - Aditya Vardhan: I know i am going to die
10/5/22, 2:30 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Everyone know they will die
10/5/22, 2:30 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Once
10/5/22, 2:30 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?
10/5/22, 2:30 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Nobody is immortal
10/5/22, 2:30 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: da
10/5/22, 2:30 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?
10/5/22, 2:30 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: what's there to be sure about? everyone's gonna die once
10/5/22, 2:30 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Yeah
10/5/22, 2:30 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Once
10/5/22, 2:30 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?
10/5/22, 2:31 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Only once
10/5/22, 2:31 PM - Ryan: Everyone?
10/5/22, 2:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: first off, you can't jump from a plane at 700kmph 500 meters above water, then not get shot

second, kamikaze attacks when successful were extremely powerful, they'd load the plane full of bombs, did a lot of damage, you need trained pilots who won't chicken out. they started kamikaze when hope for conventional warfare wins were lost for japan, and it did do a lot of damage. again, not enough to win the war due to underestimation, but it was a smart strategy
10/5/22, 2:31 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Who dies twice
10/5/22, 2:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: shadows
10/5/22, 2:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: "Sekiro‚Ñ¢: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition on Steam" https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/814380/
10/5/22, 2:31 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Human bobm
10/5/22, 2:31 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i saw a video where they paused the shadows

10/5/22, 2:32 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: irl shadows of humans
10/5/22, 2:32 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Shadow 2
10/5/22, 2:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: for a lot of people it isn't
10/5/22, 2:32 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Also
10/5/22, 2:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: the only acceptable worry upon that matter is scientific research which none of us are doing
10/5/22, 2:32 PM - Aditya Vardhan: You said they were drugged
10/5/22, 2:32 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Why
10/5/22, 2:33 PM - Aditya Vardhan: I mean how
10/5/22, 2:33 PM - Ryan: No fear

10/5/22, 2:34 PM - Ryan: Depends on drug maybe?
10/5/22, 2:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
10/5/22, 2:34 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Medicines are drugs
10/5/22, 2:34 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/5/22, 2:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: its not a "get rid of fear" drug

there are many combinations of drugs
10/5/22, 2:35 PM - Aditya Vardhan: It's possible that the drug is still legal
10/5/22, 2:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: each with very harmful effect but who cares if you'll die in the explosion anyway
10/5/22, 2:35 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: mm cocaina

10/5/22, 9:04 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 the irregularities are the things that cause friction right?

The irregularities of the surface interlock and during motion, these irregularities collide (Right?) which leads to loss of energy as heat energy right?
10/5/22, 9:06 PM - Ryan: Physics isn't my strong part

Definitely need your opinion

10/5/22, 9:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes

technically any collision is friction

friction on an atomic level is collision between particles on surfaces, that's it

10/6/22, 12:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: thermodynamics you use for heat changes in physics phenomena

some of it can describe what thermochemistry can too

so they are not thaaaat different
10/6/22, 12:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: so its essentially branch of thermodyn
10/6/22, 2:20 PM - Siddharth: https://youtube.com/shorts/zVknjz7052s?feature=share
10/6/22, 2:21 PM - Siddharth: Guys i deleted unreal engine coz my pc = ded asf. Now i am proceeding to install vs code
10/6/22, 3:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: yea ue5 is extremely laggy
10/6/22, 3:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: vscode can run on any potato
10/6/22, 3:21 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: vscode vc ue5 users
10/6/22, 3:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: you can't compare them lol
10/6/22, 3:22 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: did I?
10/6/22, 3:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: made a typo for versus
10/6/22, 3:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: so probably did
10/6/22, 3:22 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: but I did not write the comparisions did I?
10/6/22, 3:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: you did not
10/6/22, 3:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: why are we arguing about a text editor use whatever you want
10/6/22, 3:51 PM - Ryan: How can I create a weaving machine?
10/6/22, 3:51 PM - Ryan: <Media omitted>
10/6/22, 3:51 PM - Ryan: @917838968821
10/6/22, 4:09 PM - Ryan: What is this quantum entanglement
10/6/22, 4:12 PM - Dev: Can be possible
10/6/22, 4:12 PM - Dev: Google the structure of a weaving machins
10/6/22, 4:13 PM - Dev: And copy
10/6/22, 4:13 PM - Dev: üòÉ
10/6/22, 4:17 PM - Navya: he do be studying now
10/6/22, 4:18 PM - Navya: phone off karke padhta h
10/6/22, 4:18 PM - Amritansh: Guys
10/6/22, 4:18 PM - Amritansh: Pls help
10/6/22, 4:18 PM - Navya: what happened
10/6/22, 4:18 PM - Navya: @917303043520
10/6/22, 4:18 PM - Amritansh: <Media omitted>
10/6/22, 4:18 PM - Navya: ?
10/6/22, 4:19 PM - Amritansh: Solve the riddle
10/6/22, 4:19 PM - Navya: idk bye btw
10/6/22, 4:20 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: the voiced that voiced the voice was the voice that voiced the voice
10/6/22, 4:20 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: oh my god my braincells
10/6/22, 4:20 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i cant process what i just said
10/6/22, 4:24 PM - Dev: Dm dhek
10/6/22, 4:25 PM - Aditya Vardhan: 4:20
10/6/22, 4:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: bro idk i made a toy table using it not a _weaving machine_
10/6/22, 4:30 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: lmao
10/6/22, 4:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: ‚úÖ
10/6/22, 4:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: please literally i am sorry
10/6/22, 4:31 PM - Ryan: Oh
10/6/22, 4:31 PM - Ryan: That is quite tough

For weaving machines on the internet have variable structures
10/6/22, 4:32 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: bingle
10/6/22, 4:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: i don't know how quantum entanglement works, weird phenomena which makes particles have same "state", and it is somehow used in qubits in quantum computers
10/6/22, 4:32 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: bongler
10/6/22, 4:33 PM - Ryan: What does it mean when the particles have similar quantum states

What is a quantum state
10/6/22, 4:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: wahi t≈ç, i don't know
10/6/22, 4:33 PM - Ryan: What does it mean

"Indefinite until measured"
10/6/22, 4:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: indeterminate you mean
10/6/22, 4:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: ?
10/6/22, 4:33 PM - Ryan: I don't know
10/6/22, 4:34 PM - Ryan: I am failing science in the future
10/6/22, 4:34 PM - Ryan: What makes a protein a protein
10/6/22, 4:35 PM - Ryan: Is protein a class of molecules
10/6/22, 4:36 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: whey protein üëçüèª
10/6/22, 4:36 PM - Ryan: That is actually a protein
10/6/22, 4:36 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yes
10/6/22, 4:36 PM - Ryan: I thought it was just a name
10/6/22, 4:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: I saw a video, is it harvested from dairy products
10/6/22, 4:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: mostly paneer
10/6/22, 4:37 PM - Ryan: Until I found out it is in milk
10/6/22, 4:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yeaaa milk
10/6/22, 4:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: they make powder
10/6/22, 4:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: and sell
10/6/22, 4:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: üëçüèª
10/6/22, 4:37 PM - Ryan: üëç
10/6/22, 4:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: "NoOoO wheY pRoTein DaMagEs yOur kiDn-" ü§ì
10/6/22, 4:38 PM - Ryan: How can I separate the whey protein from the milk
10/6/22, 4:38 PM - Ryan: Can i evaporate all the water from the milk
10/6/22, 4:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: no I don't think
10/6/22, 4:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: wait
10/6/22, 4:39 PM - Ryan: At the Amul factory, I think the milk is first heated to make it thick, then hot dry air is blown on the thick milk for a long time to create milk powder I think
10/6/22, 4:39 PM - Ryan: Could be wrong though
10/6/22, 4:41 PM - Ryan: Probably no
10/6/22, 4:43 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: https://youtube.com/shorts/xUcbldMMhNo?feature=share
10/6/22, 4:43 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i saw this
10/6/22, 4:46 PM - Navya: lol
10/6/22, 4:48 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 Sepsis is caused when the body releases inflammatory chemicals in the blood stream in response to an infection which leads to a heart attack right?
10/6/22, 5:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/6/22, 5:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: unnecessarily extreme response
10/6/22, 5:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: thus reducing blood pressure and then
10/6/22, 5:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: yea
10/6/22, 5:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: bad
10/6/22, 5:47 PM - Ryan: Probably wrong
10/6/22, 5:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: huh
10/6/22, 5:48 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: uh
10/6/22, 6:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: @919818027773 dani currently has 68 videos on his channel



so he may be working on a very cool video for the 69th video, that's why no upload in sooo long
10/6/22, 6:45 PM - Dev: Yooo
10/6/22, 6:45 PM - Dev: Yeah
10/6/22, 8:00 PM - Ryan: Hmm unnecessarily?
10/6/22, 8:00 PM - Ryan: Confusing
10/6/22, 8:00 PM - Ryan: And also

Can geckos climb on Teflon plastic
10/6/22, 8:00 PM - Ryan: ?
10/6/22, 8:01 PM - Ryan: I am stupid

My Brain very smol
10/6/22, 8:02 PM - Ryan: I am kind of overrated
10/6/22, 8:02 PM - Amritansh: HELP
10/6/22, 8:02 PM - Amritansh: tell me a voice related to the voices of chernobyl
10/6/22, 8:02 PM - Amritansh: <Media omitted>
10/6/22, 8:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: Is this some test
10/6/22, 8:06 PM - Amritansh: Yes
10/6/22, 8:06 PM - Amritansh: Riddle
10/6/22, 8:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: Like body thinks an infection is much more severe than it actually is, or tries to attack itself (I think that happens with teeth?)
10/6/22, 8:09 PM - Ryan: Tries to attack itself? Autoimmunity
10/6/22, 8:09 PM - Ryan: ?
10/6/22, 8:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: people who have it are more likely to get sepsis shocks i think
10/6/22, 8:10 PM - Ryan: Is it?

Can we truly understand the severity of an infection?

Is it really not that severe?
10/6/22, 8:11 PM - Ryan: What causes autoimmunity
10/6/22, 8:11 PM - Navya: h
10/6/22, 8:11 PM - Navya: b
10/6/22, 8:11 PM - Navya: h
10/6/22, 8:11 PM - Navya: b
10/6/22, 8:11 PM - Ryan: Isn't the thymus there to prevent it?
10/6/22, 8:11 PM - Navya: h
10/6/22, 8:11 PM - Navya: b
10/6/22, 8:11 PM - Navya: h
10/6/22, 8:11 PM - Navya: b
10/6/22, 8:11 PM - Navya: hb
10/6/22, 8:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: I mean, yeah, we can

Not always, we often overestimate or underestimate

Just like the immune system can

Maybe it is severe, and if it is severe, then your body will try to fight it hard, so now you're getting the harmful effects of a bad infection and strong response, so here it won't be an unnecessarily extreme response, instead it would be an extreme response

I guess I worded it incorrectly, sepsis shocks don't always need to be unnecessarily extreme yea
10/6/22, 8:15 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 and the difference between Granulocytes(wrong spelling probably I am stupid) and lymphocytes is that the lymphocytes lack granules right?

What are these granules?
10/6/22, 8:16 PM - Ryan: Ok
10/6/22, 8:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes lymphocytes are agranulocytes, and these granules are used like something released to fight the infection
10/6/22, 8:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: lymphocytes are a type of agranulocytes*

and granulocytes another type of wbc
10/6/22, 8:18 PM - Ryan: Ok
10/6/22, 8:18 PM - Ryan: This message was deleted
10/6/22, 8:19 PM - Ryan: I am probably very wrong
10/6/22, 8:21 PM - Ryan: 2nd part wrong I think

There are phagocytes too
10/6/22, 8:21 PM - Ryan: Biology is VAST
10/6/22, 8:21 PM - Ryan: I am probably wrong with the first part too
10/6/22, 8:27 PM - Navya: h

10/6/22, 8:39 PM - Amritansh: Idk what to do
10/6/22, 8:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: what does the question mean
how do we know
10/6/22, 8:40 PM - Amritansh: Same with me
10/6/22, 8:40 PM - Amritansh: I am confused too
10/6/22, 8:40 PM - Amritansh: Its a ruddle
10/6/22, 8:40 PM - Amritansh: Riddle
10/6/22, 8:40 PM - Amritansh: That leads somewhere

10/6/22, 8:57 PM - Navya: lmao bahut kharab match hai
10/6/22, 10:39 PM - Navya: guys
10/7/22, 12:16 AM - Ryan: @917838968821 How many holes do you have on your face?
10/7/22, 12:20 AM - Ryan: Is it in single digit?
10/7/22, 12:24 AM - Ryan: How many holes do we have on our face?
10/7/22, 12:24 AM - Anant Tiwari: No
10/7/22, 12:24 AM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/7/22, 12:25 AM - Anant Tiwari: if you approximate our head to cylinder, we only have depressions, not holes on our face
10/7/22, 12:26 AM - Anant Tiwari: i mean now the width required for one to be a hole can be whatever you want, smaller than atoms and then ofcourse yea you have many holes
10/7/22, 12:26 AM - Anant Tiwari: not a useful definition IMO
10/7/22, 12:26 AM - Anant Tiwari: i do not know how many holes i have on my face and i do not know if that number is normal or abnormal compared to the rest of the population
10/7/22, 12:27 AM - Anant Tiwari: it is a difficult question but one i feel does not give me enough reason to probe deeper into, therefore i shall leave this question up to you to be answered or evaluated using your knowledge as I am nothing but a monosaccharide to your immense intellectual capabilities

10/7/22, 12:30 AM - Anant Tiwari: does a sponge have holes or is it just comprised of various depressions - is a sponge depressed? am I a sponge?
10/7/22, 12:30 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: the more the sponge absorbs
10/7/22, 12:30 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: the more it absorbs
10/7/22, 12:30 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: the more it

10/7/22, 12:35 AM - Anant Tiwari: YES IVE HEARD OF IT
10/7/22, 12:35 AM - Ryan: Why saccharides

Why don't we simply call them sugars
10/7/22, 12:35 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: sounds fictional innit
10/7/22, 12:36 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: because science!
10/7/22, 12:36 AM - Dev: Hi, I am a monosaccharide. I am billa

10/7/22, 12:36 AM - Anant Tiwari: its a razor, also called alder's razor but people named it NFLS as that sounds much cooler

if you cannot experiment something, you should not debate on it
10/7/22, 12:36 AM - Ryan: Yes
10/7/22, 12:36 AM - Anant Tiwari: but when can one say that they are incapable of experimenting something?
10/7/22, 12:36 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: it is observed that ryan has thought, quite fascinating/
10/7/22, 12:36 AM - Anant Tiwari: or when they have experimented soemthing?
10/7/22, 12:37 AM - Anant Tiwari: i think it's etymology is from latin

it certainly does sound cooler
10/7/22, 12:37 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: etsy
10/7/22, 12:38 AM - Anant Tiwari: like imagine you're a member of the FRSC in the 1,800s and then you jump out of your lab made of wood to exclaim to the world about your discovery about the structure of sugar molecules
10/7/22, 12:38 AM - Anant Tiwari: and then you just say _sugar_
10/7/22, 12:38 AM - Anant Tiwari: no one's going to believe you like that
10/7/22, 12:38 AM - Ryan: When they can't experiment it

Any further discussions and claims would feel kind of useless if there isn't any actual prove

So if it does seem to make sense, if it isn't practical and can't be experimented in real life, then it is maybe useless

Or is It?
10/7/22, 12:38 AM - Anant Tiwari: it is
10/7/22, 12:39 AM - Ryan: Are you sure?
10/7/22, 12:39 AM - Anant Tiwari: we can't say if it's useless
10/7/22, 12:39 AM - Anant Tiwari: no i am talking about the "or is it? "
10/7/22, 12:39 AM - Anant Tiwari: where do you set the boundary
10/7/22, 12:39 AM - Anant Tiwari: of being able to or not being able to experiment
10/7/22, 12:39 AM - Anant Tiwari: you can't be certain what you can or cannot investigate further
10/7/22, 12:40 AM - Ryan: Are you sure?
10/7/22, 12:40 AM - Anant Tiwari: No
10/7/22, 12:40 AM - Anant Tiwari: No one is
10/7/22, 12:40 AM - Ryan: Are you sure?
10/7/22, 12:40 AM - Anant Tiwari: We do not know if we are at the edge of science or not
10/7/22, 12:41 AM - Anant Tiwari: perhaps we already have reached the edges

but how do we know we have reached the edge?

I don't know how one can figure that out
10/7/22, 12:41 AM - Anant Tiwari: I'd go with No, I am not sure
10/7/22, 12:41 AM - Ryan: No sure=doubt

What if I have no doubt?

Even if I am wrong, I am sure right?
10/7/22, 12:41 AM - Anant Tiwari: you can be sure and be wrong
10/7/22, 12:41 AM - Ryan: Yes
10/7/22, 12:42 AM - Anant Tiwari: sureness is something you claim from your own knowledge

you can't be sure if you have all the knowledge to make the correct claim, but

you can be sure enough to make _a_ claim
10/7/22, 12:43 AM - Ryan: From your own knowledge?

Are you sure?
10/7/22, 12:43 AM - Anant Tiwari: No
10/7/22, 12:43 AM - Ryan: üòÄ
10/7/22, 12:43 AM - Anant Tiwari: I don't have all the knowledge
10/7/22, 12:43 AM - Anant Tiwari: Nor do I want to make the claim
10/7/22, 12:43 AM - Anant Tiwari: üòÖ
10/7/22, 12:43 AM - Ryan: Are you sure?
10/7/22, 12:43 AM - Anant Tiwari: No

10/7/22, 12:47 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: how desperate are you to hack us
10/7/22, 12:47 AM - Anant Tiwari: I am claiming to suggest that you should not send this message as people here already know it if they use discord and highlighting the link will increase chance of misclicks
10/7/22, 12:47 AM - Ryan: What is knowledge
10/7/22, 12:47 AM - Dev: I donno
10/7/22, 12:47 AM - Dev: Just typed a random link
10/7/22, 12:47 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: he donno
10/7/22, 12:47 AM - Dev: And boom
10/7/22, 12:47 AM - Anant Tiwari: I claim that knowledge may not be stimulus
10/7/22, 12:47 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: null
10/7/22, 12:47 AM - Dev: An actual link
10/7/22, 12:47 AM - Ryan: Then what is it?
10/7/22, 12:47 AM - Anant Tiwari: mat send kar, what if someone misclicks
10/7/22, 12:47 AM - Anant Tiwari: we all know the link is dangerous, stop sending it again and again
10/7/22, 12:48 AM - Dev: Cheetahs can't roar
10/7/22, 12:48 AM - Dev: They can meow
10/7/22, 12:48 AM - Ryan: Our veins are wet and dark
10/7/22, 12:48 AM - Dev: And growl
10/7/22, 12:48 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: maow

10/7/22, 12:48 AM - Dev: Pikachu use growl
10/7/22, 12:48 AM - Dev: This message was deleted
10/7/22, 12:48 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: i mean yeah dude they're all technically cats
10/7/22, 12:48 AM - Anant Tiwari: I claim to not be aware but I feel it might be a much more simpler concept than biochemistrical stimuli
10/7/22, 12:48 AM - Ryan: What would it feel like getting a ride in our veins
10/7/22, 12:48 AM - Ryan: A cool water slide
10/7/22, 12:48 AM - Anant Tiwari: Are you sure
10/7/22, 12:48 AM - Anant Tiwari: üòÄ

10/7/22, 12:49 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: and you need to be tiny
10/7/22, 12:49 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: since nerves long, it will take a lot of time
10/7/22, 12:49 AM - Ryan: You must not inject any bioluminescent fluid in your veins
10/7/22, 12:49 AM - Dev: Can injecting some air into blood vessel
10/7/22, 12:50 AM - Dev: Kill someone?
10/7/22, 12:50 AM - Ryan: Or else
10/7/22, 12:50 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: and even if you finish the ride, where will you go?

10/7/22, 12:58 AM - Anant Tiwari: but why did it shoot it upon you?

Water is a fairly incompressible fluid

Pushing the plunge of the syringe reduced the volume in the shaft of the syringe

But once the volume of water matched the volume of the shaft, any further force would make the fluid push against the walls of the shaft of the syringe much harder

This can cause it to explode

But in a normal, unplugged syringe, there is a nozzle for the water to escape

So upon more compression, the water gets forced through the nozzle as that is easier and it has more time to do that rather than explode the syringe

Hence, due to the fast movement of the plunger of the syringe, it forced the water out at great velocity, which proceeded to land upon you

10/8/22, 11:18 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY EVERYONES GOOD? HOW DOES IT BENEFIT US?

"ohhh amrit removed me its for my own good"

ITS NOT LIKE THE PERSON IS GONNA STOP SWEARING?
10/8/22, 11:18 PM - Dev: So I have a problem with this group
10/8/22, 11:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: key points:

Don't make a new group,

no one will join,

no one wants another group with hundreds of messages,

we should not isolate someone like this in our class

we should not spam because it makes conversations hard to find

we should not swear too much as people's parents go through phone

admins should not remove unnecessarily
10/8/22, 11:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: bhai calm down first
10/8/22, 11:18 PM - Aditya Vardhan: (i am asking actually) not being rude or smth
10/8/22, 11:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: no caps
10/8/22, 11:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: no all caps
10/8/22, 11:19 PM - Dev: Too much we can't do a tony bit too
10/8/22, 11:19 PM - Navya: darash dont start this all stuffs again.
first of all there are certain reasons and stuff that he makes these rules
understand dude.
10/8/22, 11:19 PM - Dev: Tiny*
10/8/22, 11:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: uska ek point galat hoga, doesn't disprove other points

ultimately parents check karte hai phone for some people

you cant change that

so we delete messages to be safe
10/8/22, 11:19 PM - Dev: Ok
10/8/22, 11:19 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: null
10/8/22, 11:19 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: what dude no one follows them
10/8/22, 11:19 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Ok so you guys just want democracy

10/9/22, 7:12 AM - Anant Tiwari: i found out about this song from that same discord server lol

remember rhaghendolph? who i messaged about toast? he mentioned ultratoastypatrick, who's a mod. last year, some day he was streaming his code in the voice channel, and he had that playing in the background

so i went ahead and listened to it, found it absolutely poggers üëç
10/9/22, 8:57 AM - Anant Tiwari: holy shit internet came back 3 mins before exam lmao
10/9/22, 10:07 AM - Aditya Vardhan: You have the guts to ask for the number

10/9/22, 10:30 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: ohhh haaha
10/9/22, 10:53 AM - Ryan: Is that even possible

Is there any chemical which has a PH of 14 or above

Sodium hydroxide is one of the strongest bases

And it's PH is 9 I think
10/9/22, 10:54 AM - Ryan: I don't know I am wrong probably
10/9/22, 10:55 AM - Ryan: If there is a chemical solution with PH 14

How corrosive would it be
10/9/22, 11:26 AM - Anant Tiwari: No, its not 9
10/9/22, 11:27 AM - Anant Tiwari: Sodium Hydroxide has pH of ~14, some things have >14 or <0 too but then the ph scale becomes kinda useless
10/9/22, 11:27 AM - Anant Tiwari: anyway I finished paper 1
10/9/22, 11:27 AM - Anant Tiwari: very torturous
10/9/22, 11:27 AM - Anant Tiwari: having to sit 2 hour 30 mins

10/9/22, 11:39 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: ooh intense moment
10/9/22, 12:14 PM - Ryan: Does it depend on the concentration
10/9/22, 12:42 PM - Aditya Vardhan: (+) + (+) =  +
(-)  +  (-) =  +
(-)  + (+) =  -
(+) + (-)  = -

Even + even = even
Odd + odd = even
Odd + even = odd
Even + odd = even
10/9/22, 12:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: ok buddy, no
10/9/22, 12:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: don't use odd or even to represent binary digits
10/9/22, 12:45 PM - Ryan: (-)+(-)=(-)?

10/9/22, 12:46 PM - Parth: Yup
10/9/22, 12:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: are the (-) operators or signs
10/9/22, 12:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: or either
10/9/22, 12:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: like, just don't say - -++++- - -+ - - + - whatever, it doesn't make sense, it's ambiguous

take a variable, then do calculations upon it
10/9/22, 12:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: internet died lol
10/9/22, 12:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: like are the - in brackets for terms, and the ones without are operators?
10/9/22, 12:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: i do not understand
10/9/22, 12:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: kinda panic because lights keep going out so what if i cant do paper

10/10/22, 12:11 AM - Anant Tiwari: They removed us from that team
10/10/22, 12:11 AM - Anant Tiwari: So some school teachers definitely read your message
10/10/22, 12:11 AM - Anant Tiwari: Literally

10/10/22, 12:12 AM - Aditya Vardhan: Blue whale has a way larger brain
10/10/22, 12:12 AM - Aditya Vardhan: But is it smarter than humans?
10/10/22, 12:12 AM - Aditya Vardhan: No
10/10/22, 12:12 AM - Aditya Vardhan: Hence size dosent matter
10/10/22, 12:13 AM - Anant Tiwari: structure
10/10/22, 12:13 AM - Anant Tiwari: matter
10/10/22, 12:13 AM - Anant Tiwari: remember?
10/10/22, 12:13 AM - Dev: Maybe it is we haven't checked yet
10/10/22, 12:13 AM - Anant Tiwari: you have same structure of brain as isaac newton
but not same structure of thought
10/10/22, 12:13 AM - Anant Tiwari: not same will power

10/10/22, 12:39 AM - Anant Tiwari: so if you're lactose intolerant in any galaxy, cope karle
10/10/22, 12:39 AM - Aditya Vardhan: There are people in Andromeda
10/10/22, 12:39 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: lmao
10/10/22, 12:39 AM - Anant Tiwari: Maybe
10/10/22, 12:40 AM - Aditya Vardhan: Lactose intolerant earthlings when they find out. They live in the milky way
10/10/22, 12:40 AM - Anant Tiwari: üòÉ
10/10/22, 12:40 AM - Aditya Vardhan: Ab theek he

10/10/22, 4:21 AM - Anant Tiwari: thog dont caare
10/10/22, 9:18 AM - Ryan: Size does matter

Brain to body ratio

And the structure of the brain
10/10/22, 9:18 AM - Aditya Vardhan: Chup
10/10/22, 9:19 AM - Aditya Vardhan: Size dosent matter
10/10/22, 9:19 AM - Ryan: What

Galactose
10/10/22, 9:19 AM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/10/22, 9:19 AM - Ryan: Why do you think size doesn't matter?
10/10/22, 9:20 AM - Ryan: The size of your brain, your body it all matters
10/10/22, 9:21 AM - Ryan: Brain shrink

You get alzheimers
10/10/22, 9:21 AM - Ryan: Size matters in a lot of things I think
10/10/22, 9:24 AM - Ryan: In nature it can act as a defense and as a sign of superiority

Elephants (very few natural predators...especially of the adult one

Whales (very few natural predators)

The cringe humans are using hacks and technology minimize the difficulty level, making them able to kill almost all the animals
10/10/22, 9:24 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: ü´Ç
10/10/22, 9:25 AM - Ryan: It does
10/10/22, 9:25 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: im not saying ki "size doesn't matter"
10/10/22, 9:25 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: i know it does
10/10/22, 9:25 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: you pointed out a few examples
10/10/22, 9:25 AM - Ryan: Ok

The break is almost over

No more fun, no more relaxation, no more ignorance, no procrastination

Only intense studying
10/10/22, 12:24 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: please leave me alone
10/10/22, 12:25 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: what do you mean intense studying
10/10/22, 12:25 PM - Dev: No
10/10/22, 12:25 PM - Dev: üòÉ
10/10/22, 12:25 PM - Ryan: Sterols are a sub-group of steroids?

Steroids are molecules derived from gonane right?
10/10/22, 12:25 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: üòÇü´±üèª‚Äçü´≤üèª
10/10/22, 12:25 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: testosterone üëçüèª
10/10/22, 12:26 PM - Ryan: Hmm
10/10/22, 12:26 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?
10/10/22, 12:28 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
10/10/22, 12:28 PM - Ryan: I believe Term-2 would be a point of self-realization for students who didn't get good marks

So I hope they would study and focus in class much better

But kids are stupid, can't expect anything from them
10/10/22, 12:28 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>

isn't that the same case every year?

"i did bad last year, time to do better this time"

and then it's a loop
10/10/22, 12:29 PM - Ryan: Hajmola?
10/10/22, 12:29 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: anadrol
10/10/22, 12:29 PM - Ryan: Oh ok
10/10/22, 12:30 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ah yes hajmola steroids
10/10/22, 12:30 PM - Ryan: Truly
10/10/22, 12:31 PM - Ryan: In 9th I believe they would get even worse marks

The one who aren't serious as of now
10/10/22, 12:31 PM - Ryan: Even the toppers, they seem wierd
10/10/22, 12:32 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: aren't you one of the toppers aswell?

no I'm not calling you weird
10/10/22, 12:32 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: your statement sounds like you're not a part of them
10/10/22, 12:32 PM - Ryan: I don't think so
10/10/22, 12:33 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: more than 75 marks is considered as topper marks

you get 79 or 80 in every exam
10/10/22, 12:33 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: why do you not think so
10/10/22, 12:34 PM - Ryan: Because of the trip, it seems like all the class 8th students are wierd

No fear, no manners

Their interests are useless, their desires are stupid, their mouth speaks more than their actions
10/10/22, 12:34 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?
10/10/22, 12:35 PM - Ryan: Marks are stupid

Anyone can get high marks
10/10/22, 12:35 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i mean, they're just enjoying innit?

why do they have to fear?
what's there to fear from?

also did you not have a good experience from the trip
10/10/22, 12:35 PM - Ryan: Intelligence matters, the learning

And I am not intelligent
10/10/22, 12:35 PM - Dev: H
10/10/22, 12:35 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: true, but not everyone does
10/10/22, 12:36 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i might say you are

you and anant know chemistry better than any of us in the class
10/10/22, 12:36 PM - Ryan: They were enjoying like animals

At day 1 only, I believe someone would have started a fight
10/10/22, 12:36 PM - Ryan: No
10/10/22, 12:36 PM - Ryan: Chemistry is truly vast
10/10/22, 12:36 PM - Ryan: Humongous
10/10/22, 12:36 PM - Dev: Frozen egg
10/10/22, 12:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i would've left, wtf

animals? are you that sure lmao
10/10/22, 12:37 PM - Ryan: I don't know anything about chemistry
10/10/22, 12:37 PM - Dev: Lol
10/10/22, 12:37 PM - Ryan: Seriously they were beastly
10/10/22, 12:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: üà∑Ô∏è, I'm sorry i had to make an among us joke

@917838968821 sorry
10/10/22, 12:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: hhhh bruh lol
10/10/22, 12:37 PM - Dev: Very cold
10/10/22, 12:38 PM - Dev: The minimum temp will drop in the following days
10/10/22, 12:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: but atleast you know part of it?
10/10/22, 12:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: fhshfhjejdjrjsjd
10/10/22, 12:38 PM - Ryan: No
10/10/22, 12:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: I don't know man
10/10/22, 12:38 PM - Dev: Sometimes
10/10/22, 12:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: I just don't wanna

10/10/22, 12:39 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Here we go again
10/10/22, 12:39 PM - Dev: The max temp in the following days will be 31
10/10/22, 12:39 PM - Dev: According to the prediction
10/10/22, 12:39 PM - Dev: It may be 21
10/10/22, 12:39 PM - Ryan: I don't know

The teachers accompanying us?
10/10/22, 12:39 PM - Dev: Who knows
10/10/22, 12:40 PM - Ryan: It is stupid to share literally everything with your teachers

They did not think twice before speaking
10/10/22, 12:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: that means something wild happened
10/10/22, 12:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: how many did you see
10/10/22, 12:41 PM - Ryan: Their voices

Loud and clear, stupid and vulgar
10/10/22, 12:41 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: bruh, did the teachers hear them?
10/10/22, 12:41 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/10/22, 12:41 PM - Ryan: Loud and clear
10/10/22, 12:41 PM - Ryan: There was a little child too
10/10/22, 12:41 PM - Ryan: Yet they didn't think twice

10/10/22, 12:42 PM - Ryan: I was quiet
10/10/22, 12:42 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: This message was deleted

10/10/22, 12:42 PM - Ryan: It seems wierd
10/10/22, 12:42 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: bruh lol, tf were the teachers doing
10/10/22, 12:43 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: maybe they didn't care cause 8th graders
10/10/22, 12:43 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: üëçüèª
10/10/22, 12:43 PM - Ryan: I don't know

They were acting too friendly

Maybe to make us feel comfortable
10/10/22, 12:43 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yeah
10/10/22, 12:43 PM - Ryan: But children not need to be comfortable
10/10/22, 12:43 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i bet someone missed their family a bit too much
10/10/22, 12:43 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: üòÉ
10/10/22, 12:44 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: was you train cabin claustrophobic?
10/10/22, 12:44 PM - Ryan: 8th graders are pathetic

They are children with slightly grown bodies that's all
10/10/22, 12:44 PM - Ryan: No
10/10/22, 12:44 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: maybee not all?

Most people can speak English

Three  shrutisambhinnarthak shabd ratta will not help you converse
10/10/22, 12:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: do you remember that youtube short
10/10/22, 12:56 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/10/22, 12:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: No

10/10/22, 12:57 PM - Ryan: Probably
10/10/22, 12:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: When was the last time you used one of them in daily conversation
10/10/22, 12:57 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: exactly lol

almost half of the world speaks English right? or maybe more than half
10/10/22, 12:57 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: hhhfhrhfjjdjsjdrj no dementia
10/10/22, 12:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: a lot of people in india don't know English

10/10/22, 12:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: but will you use that in general conversations
10/10/22, 12:57 PM - Ryan: And a language
10/10/22, 12:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: does the avdhi word actually help share more ideas
10/10/22, 12:57 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: true, like the hindi which is actually used in the real word
10/10/22, 12:58 PM - Ryan: The difference between similar sounding words is necessary
10/10/22, 12:58 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/10/22, 12:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: also i don't think you know avdhi, avdhi is one of those bol√≠
10/10/22, 12:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: criteria of acceptability
10/10/22, 12:58 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: "kele kitne ke"

"pehle 1-20 chapter 15 paryaivachi shabd sunao, class 8 ke"
10/10/22, 12:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: it's enough to converse in the use cases I'll experience
10/10/22, 12:58 PM - Ryan: Can you converse in pure hindi (without the use of any English word) for a whole day
10/10/22, 12:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: No I can't
10/10/22, 12:58 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/10/22, 12:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: That's not my criteria of acceptable
10/10/22, 12:59 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: pure hindi? no
normal and modern hindi? yes
10/10/22, 12:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: yea buddy
10/10/22, 12:59 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/10/22, 12:59 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
10/10/22, 12:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes?? It's the criteria I set up
10/10/22, 12:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: You said something different
10/10/22, 12:59 PM - Ryan: What is normal and modern hindi
10/10/22, 12:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: Pure hindi for a day
10/10/22, 12:59 PM - Ryan: Question mark
10/10/22, 12:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: I said enough to converse with people who have little knowledge
10/10/22, 12:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes. *It's the criteria I set up
10/10/22, 12:59 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ryan please stop with the "are you sure" questions, it's making me question reality and I'm on the verge of dying from an existential crisis
10/10/22, 1:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: too bad
10/10/22, 1:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: run
10/10/22, 1:00 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: the difference is that the
10/10/22, 1:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: you don't need to point out differences
10/10/22, 1:00 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ‚òπÔ∏è gustavo
10/10/22, 1:00 PM - Ryan: Little knowledge

10/10/22, 1:00 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: "DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN PURE AND NORMAL HINDI FHDJDJJDJJEJD"
10/10/22, 1:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: do it
10/10/22, 1:01 PM - Ryan: The people who have little knowledge in English

Wouldn't they have a large knowledge in hindi?
10/10/22, 1:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/10/22, 1:01 PM - Ryan: As their conversations are mainly done in hindi

They may learn new words every week or so
10/10/22, 1:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
10/10/22, 1:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: Exponential decay of word growth
10/10/22, 1:01 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/10/22, 1:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: I mean
10/10/22, 1:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: Depends on the person
10/10/22, 1:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: Are you sure? Do they really need to learn new words?
10/10/22, 1:02 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: okay so pure hindi is hindi used in old times, where "aap" was used

for example, aap kya kaam kar rahe ho


normal hindi mein people don't really use "aap" unless it's someone elder

we mostly use "tu" or "tum"

for example, tu kya kar raha hai
10/10/22, 1:02 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/10/22, 1:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: Well
10/10/22, 1:02 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: basic differences
10/10/22, 1:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: That's a bad definition
10/10/22, 1:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: That's even worse
10/10/22, 1:02 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/10/22, 1:03 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: are you speaking about people in india or people abroad
10/10/22, 1:03 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
10/10/22, 1:03 PM - Ryan: India
10/10/22, 1:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: How many completely new general conversation English words have you learned this week without dedicated effort
10/10/22, 1:03 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: india has many languages
10/10/22, 1:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: lingua franca is hindi and english
10/10/22, 1:03 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: amazing

10/10/22, 1:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: Because biology
10/10/22, 1:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: That's not something you'll use in everyday concepts

10/10/22, 10:53 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: would go inside
10/10/22, 10:53 PM - Ryan: You all have all our data

You all know each other's address, contacts, probably blood type too, mode of transport and bus routes etc
10/10/22, 10:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: It hurts to
10/10/22, 10:53 PM - Ryan: We all are equal
10/10/22, 10:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: But don't worry
10/10/22, 10:53 PM - Parth: Imagine rayn in pink hair
10/10/22, 10:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: Your head skin will protect

10/10/22, 10:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: üòÉ
10/10/22, 10:55 PM - Navya: joke
10/10/22, 10:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: "my hair"
"i dyed it"
10/10/22, 10:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: naaaaa
10/10/22, 10:55 PM - Navya: haw gali di
10/10/22, 10:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: ‚òπÔ∏è
10/10/22, 10:56 PM - Navya: say sorry
10/10/22, 10:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: Rule #1: Never say sorry
10/10/22, 10:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: Alpha
10/10/22, 10:56 PM - Navya: gives same vibe as
"OUR TABLE..ITS BROKEN"
10/10/22, 10:56 PM - You removed Navya
10/10/22, 10:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
10/10/22, 10:59 PM - You reset this group's invite link
10/10/22, 10:59 PM - Ryan: I think the only thing we don't know about each other is our IP address, Private IP address, WiFi password and things from our private life
10/10/22, 11:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: Private IP address is meaningless
10/10/22, 11:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: Public ID address is very easy to get
10/10/22, 11:00 PM - Ryan: Or do we?

@917838968821 may know all these
10/10/22, 11:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: I know someone's wifi password here
10/10/22, 11:00 PM - Ryan: Really

I want to know how
10/10/22, 11:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: Well

Make a game

Set up a webserver

Then put some IP logger code in it

Ask @919999373163 to run on his computer and see if it runs

IP is now logged

Profit
10/10/22, 11:01 PM - Ryan: Instead of using tools and apps
10/10/22, 11:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: _Not_ based on a true story
10/10/22, 11:02 PM - Ryan: What if someone never logs in

I think a stranger would not log in or click on a link sent by a stranger
10/10/22, 11:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes but telling people to click on an IP Grabber link is not that successful of a command
10/10/22, 11:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: But no one expects your friend to put an IP logger in a game which they ask you to test
10/10/22, 11:02 PM - Ryan: But I think the information we have as of now about each other is kind of useless
10/10/22, 11:02 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: this video was sponsored by Nord VPN
10/10/22, 11:03 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: I would like to take this time to tell you about our amazing sponsor for tonight
10/10/22, 11:03 PM - Ryan: Even if I know all these, what will I do

You know your surroundings better than me, I don't know what kind of equipment you have, I basically know nothing
10/10/22, 11:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: And then your friend (aka idiot) runs the game
10/10/22, 11:03 PM - Dev: Hello
10/10/22, 11:03 PM - Dev: Greetings
10/10/22, 11:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: He whatsapps you that the game runs fine and it's poggers
10/10/22, 11:03 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: me and anant do
10/10/22, 11:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: And then you get his IP address
10/10/22, 11:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: Easy
10/10/22, 11:04 PM - Ryan: Are you sure

Tell me where is worm
10/10/22, 11:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: Remember I asked you to get out of your room for a minute once? Also ever noticed that beeping sound in your room
10/10/22, 11:04 PM - Ryan: I have a room?
10/10/22, 11:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: Not you
10/10/22, 11:05 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: apparently mere dost ko school ki taraf se chutti milgayo
10/10/22, 11:05 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: milgayi
10/10/22, 11:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: chutti

10/10/22, 11:10 PM - Ryan: This information threat

Is scary and makes a person feel angry
10/10/22, 11:10 PM - Dev: 2. Uhh

10/10/22, 11:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: Idiot
10/10/22, 11:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
10/10/22, 11:11 PM - Ryan: While the probability is that they will never do anything

A false sense of insecurity

Fills you with anger
10/10/22, 11:11 PM - Dev: null
10/10/22, 11:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: The probability
10/10/22, 11:11 PM - Dev: This message was deleted

10/10/22, 11:12 PM - Dev: This message was deleted
10/10/22, 11:12 PM - Dev: Spelling issue
10/10/22, 11:12 PM - Dev: Sun fish are very dumb
10/10/22, 11:12 PM - Anant Tiwari: Hey so you're a fish
10/10/22, 11:12 PM - Anant Tiwari: Wow
10/10/22, 11:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ryan can I call you
10/10/22, 11:13 PM - Dev: ‚òπÔ∏è
10/10/22, 11:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: What
10/10/22, 11:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: What's wrong
10/10/22, 11:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: I just said you're a fish
10/10/22, 11:13 PM - Ryan: Seriously

For serious action

It would take atleast 2-4 days of private stalking and spying to lead to some actual damage (successful damage I think)

Otherwise even if I know your address

I don't know how your home looks like, where all the things

You have the advantage

And the police too is kind of a problem

If I know the person who is the threat

I can simply inform the police

But this data seems so vulnerable
10/10/22, 11:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: üòÑüê†
10/10/22, 11:13 PM - Ryan: I know you will track me
10/10/22, 11:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: You deleted this message

10/10/22, 11:14 PM - Ryan: It probably needs a long conversation and some serious skills
10/10/22, 11:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/10/22, 11:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: Guys 3 minutes

10/11/22, 9:56 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
10/11/22, 9:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: something used to make something else
10/11/22, 9:57 PM - Ryan: Air is used to make what?
10/11/22, 9:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: eg Methacrylic acid is a material because it is used to make acrylic, Carbon dioxide is also a material

many things are materials
10/11/22, 9:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: Air has carbon dioxide

Carbon does a lot of cool things
10/11/22, 9:58 PM - Ryan: Probably
10/11/22, 9:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: Pretty much everything can be used to make something so probably most things are materials
10/11/22, 9:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: Why probably
10/11/22, 9:58 PM - Ryan: I don't know
10/11/22, 9:58 PM - Ryan: What is cool actually?

10/11/22, 10:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: Define limit then

We are lazy and don't want to, say, desalinate water

Technically yeah it's unlimited, keeps getting renewed

Or is it?
10/11/22, 10:01 PM - Ryan: What does unlimited quantity mean according to chapter 5 in science
10/11/22, 10:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: Nothing
10/11/22, 10:01 PM - Ryan: Is air really unlimited? Is sunlight unlimited?
10/11/22, 10:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: Its a very basic definition
10/11/22, 10:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: I mean for most people yes

10/12/22, 8:59 PM - Aditya Vardhan: New mobile after getting scolded
10/12/22, 8:59 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Maybe
10/12/22, 9:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: dude this is the 3rd+ time atleast
10/12/22, 9:00 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Yeah
10/12/22, 9:00 PM - Aditya Vardhan: I know
10/12/22, 9:00 PM - Aditya Vardhan: üòÉ
10/12/22, 9:00 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Or i just don't get a mobile
10/12/22, 9:00 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Live without it
10/12/22, 9:00 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Or just repair it
10/12/22, 9:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: you can't keep saying "you'll deal with this problem later" (raging out)

what is your mitigation tactic from now

or is there none still

because I'll be honest, you messed up, daat t≈ç padegi, but it doesn't matter

but you gotta prevent this from happening ever again, because damn that's not normal
10/12/22, 9:01 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Um
10/12/22, 9:01 PM - Navya: lmao
10/12/22, 9:01 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Yeah
10/12/22, 9:01 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Youre right
10/12/22, 9:01 PM - Aditya Vardhan: But
10/12/22, 9:02 PM - Aditya Vardhan: I should put a cover
10/12/22, 9:02 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Actually 2
10/12/22, 9:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: it doesn't matter screen is broken

you can live with broken screen easily

what matters is that eventually you can't fix the broken screen, once you drop it enough times
10/12/22, 9:02 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Not the 3rd
10/12/22, 9:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: or perhaps behavioural changes
10/12/22, 9:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: you can't put screen protector on everything
10/12/22, 9:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: i don't have one, only a case which probably is not that useful
10/12/22, 9:03 PM - Aditya Vardhan: I donno man
10/12/22, 9:03 PM - Aditya Vardhan: üòÉ
10/12/22, 9:03 PM - Aditya Vardhan: I rage quite rarely
10/12/22, 9:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: yea that happens with everyone

but we should try to "know" after mistake man
10/12/22, 9:03 PM - Aditya Vardhan: But when I do
10/12/22, 9:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: yeah but throwing ‚Çπ15,000+ thing
10/12/22, 9:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: what if that happens to, say a family photo

can't repair that
10/12/22, 9:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: you have to face the problem eventually
10/12/22, 9:04 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Leave it
10/12/22, 9:04 PM - Aditya Vardhan: I think
10/12/22, 9:04 PM - Aditya Vardhan: I will buy a cover
10/12/22, 9:04 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Protector

10/13/22, 2:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: complete combustion
10/13/22, 2:04 PM - Dev: If you don't brun them properly they relses carbon monoxide
10/13/22, 2:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: all fuel get oxidized uniformly and completely
10/13/22, 2:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: YES
10/13/22, 2:04 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ah yes

10/13/22, 2:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: extreme
10/13/22, 2:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: no oxygen transportation?
10/13/22, 2:04 PM - Dev: So brun properly
10/13/22, 2:04 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: heater switched on in a closed room
10/13/22, 2:04 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: null
10/13/22, 2:04 PM - Dev: Like
10/13/22, 2:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: SAY THAT SHIT AGAIN
10/13/22, 2:04 PM - Dev: The heater with rods
10/13/22, 2:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: does a heater use coal
10/13/22, 2:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: does it
10/13/22, 2:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes or no
10/13/22, 2:05 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: that shit

10/13/22, 2:05 PM - Dev: Depends
10/13/22, 2:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: ha
10/13/22, 2:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: but none of you use a coal heater
10/13/22, 2:05 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: doends
10/13/22, 2:05 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i do
10/13/22, 2:05 PM - Dev: What kind of heater tou use
10/13/22, 2:05 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i live under a rock
10/13/22, 2:05 PM - You removed Wernher Von Kerman
10/13/22, 2:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: What heater do you use
10/13/22, 2:05 PM - Dev: Coal heaters are stupid
10/13/22, 2:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: Good
10/13/22, 2:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: Exactly
10/13/22, 2:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: And dangerous
10/13/22, 2:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: And inefficient
10/13/22, 2:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: And slow
10/13/22, 2:05 PM - Dev: They don't even provide that much heat
10/13/22, 2:06 PM - Dev: Yes
10/13/22, 2:06 PM - You added Wernher Von Kerman
10/13/22, 2:40 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 How do very thin bacteria maintain their structure after being bombarded with electrons?

Why aren't bigger (or thicker)microorganisms able to maintain their structure in the same scenario?
10/13/22, 2:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't think electron microscopes have that much energy..

Can you give some examples of these larger microbes which are affected
10/13/22, 2:44 PM - Ryan: Glutaraldehyde and Osmium Tetroxide are used in cell fixation right? And I think many more chemicals are used

Why?
10/13/22, 2:44 PM - Ryan: Bacteria
10/13/22, 2:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: uhhhhhh i did not know they were affected
10/13/22, 2:45 PM - Ryan: I think I am wrong with a part

Bacteria are generally thicker than the required thickness to maintain the structure (20-100nm I think)
10/13/22, 2:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: osmium tetroxide bonds with some enzyme and that prevents damage, i don't know about glutaraldhhdhrhfhd tho
10/13/22, 2:45 PM - Ryan: Is there any organism that thin?

I would guess maybe some viruses but I don't know
10/13/22, 2:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: Uhh kinda close, smallest are about 0.2 micrond
10/13/22, 2:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: Viruses yea probably
10/13/22, 2:48 PM - Navya: I DONT KNOW WHAT YOU DID
10/13/22, 2:48 PM - Ryan: What are accelerated electrons?
10/13/22, 2:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: an electron which gets accelerated
10/13/22, 2:49 PM - Ryan: üò∂
10/13/22, 2:49 PM - Ryan: How
10/13/22, 2:49 PM - Ryan: And to what speeds?
10/13/22, 2:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: Just a magnetic field??

10/13/22, 4:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: Equal judicial treatment to everyone, no discrimination
10/13/22, 4:16 PM - Ryan: What is "fair treatment"?
10/13/22, 4:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: treating everyone the same way
10/13/22, 4:17 PM - Amritansh 2: No discrimination on the basis of cast, gender etc.
10/13/22, 4:17 PM - Amritansh 2: Ye
10/13/22, 4:17 PM - Ryan: That is equality right?
10/13/22, 4:17 PM - Amritansh 2: Ye
10/13/22, 4:17 PM - Ryan: It can't be particularly positive or negative right?
10/13/22, 4:17 PM - Amritansh 2: Hmm
10/13/22, 4:17 PM - Amritansh 2: Also
10/13/22, 4:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes, there is not much difference

Why do we cail mail "snail mail"
E-mail is now just called mail
10/13/22, 4:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: Justice usually meant for judicial wise
10/13/22, 4:18 PM - Amritansh 2: When was BHU established (Bihar Hindu University)
10/13/22, 4:18 PM - Amritansh 2: 5
10/13/22, 4:18 PM - Amritansh 2: 4
10/13/22, 4:18 PM - Amritansh 2: 3
10/13/22, 4:18 PM - Amritansh 2: 2
10/13/22, 4:18 PM - Amritansh 2: 1
10/13/22, 4:18 PM - Amritansh 2: Up!
10/13/22, 4:18 PM - Amritansh 2: It established in 1916
10/13/22, 4:18 PM - Ryan: Now what is that
10/13/22, 4:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ki everyone can get their voices represented in court

Again that's essentially just Equality
10/13/22, 4:18 PM - Ryan: Ok
10/13/22, 4:18 PM - Amritansh 2: Civilizing the natives
10/13/22, 4:18 PM - Amritansh 2: In History
10/13/22, 4:18 PM - Amritansh 2: Was reading that
10/13/22, 4:18 PM - Ryan: Ok
10/13/22, 4:20 PM - Ryan: Is that really justice?

If a person commits murder, but all murderers get bare minimum punishment like 3 months in jail

Is that justice?
10/13/22, 4:20 PM - Amritansh 2: Commits arson*
10/13/22, 4:20 PM - Amritansh 2: No!
10/13/22, 4:21 PM - Amritansh 2: 3 months is too less
10/13/22, 4:21 PM - Ryan: Then what is justice
10/13/22, 4:21 PM - Amritansh 2: And you can't recover a death by putting the murderer in jail
10/13/22, 4:21 PM - Amritansh 2: You have to give financial aids too...
10/13/22, 4:22 PM - Ryan: You can't recover a death through any means
10/13/22, 4:22 PM - Ryan: Does the court do that
10/13/22, 4:22 PM - Amritansh 2: It's just balancing the equation. Like if McDonalds charges you 5 Paisa more, you would have to get the 5 Paisa back and that will be called justice. Jailing the cashier wouldn't be justice.
10/13/22, 4:22 PM - Amritansh 2: No, but the government does on most cases
10/13/22, 4:23 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/13/22, 4:24 PM - Amritansh 2: Yes
10/13/22, 4:24 PM - Ryan: How do you balance a equation with the LHS murder
10/13/22, 4:25 PM - Ryan: What could satisfy the RHS
10/13/22, 4:25 PM - Amritansh 2: Killing
10/13/22, 4:25 PM - Ryan: That probably depends on the person?
10/13/22, 4:25 PM - Amritansh 2: Ye
10/13/22, 4:25 PM - Amritansh 2: What the family wants
10/13/22, 4:25 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/13/22, 4:25 PM - Amritansh 2: I mean it is a big crime
10/13/22, 4:27 PM - Ryan: Is Justice personal?

Differs from person to person then?
10/13/22, 4:27 PM - Amritansh 2: Ya
10/13/22, 4:27 PM - Ryan: What if the family wants the murderer to be free, will that be justice?
10/13/22, 4:27 PM - Ryan: Will you find it justice?
10/13/22, 4:27 PM - Amritansh 2: Like if you want your 5 Paisa back or jail the cashier
10/13/22, 4:27 PM - Amritansh 2: Yes
10/13/22, 4:27 PM - Amritansh 2: But for the family
10/13/22, 4:27 PM - Amritansh 2: Not for the country
10/13/22, 4:28 PM - Amritansh 2: But that woulldnt be allowed
10/13/22, 4:28 PM - Amritansh 2: Because then the murderer could commit more murders
10/13/22, 4:28 PM - Ryan: Can you jail the cashier?

It's McDonalds which is adding the additional 5 Paisa to the bill right?

Or the cashier
10/13/22, 4:28 PM - Amritansh 2: Cashier
10/13/22, 4:28 PM - Amritansh 2: But yeah we can sue McDonald's too
10/13/22, 4:29 PM - Ryan: So according to you, justice is related to self satisfaction?
10/13/22, 4:29 PM - Amritansh 2: No
10/13/22, 4:29 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/13/22, 4:29 PM - Amritansh 2: It's cross related between the country and the familt
10/13/22, 4:29 PM - Amritansh 2: Yes
10/13/22, 4:30 PM - Ryan: Really?
10/13/22, 4:30 PM - Amritansh 2: The country should agree and the family should be satisfied
10/13/22, 4:31 PM - Ryan: What if no family?

What If someone commits murder to a person who has no family?
10/13/22, 4:31 PM - Amritansh 2: Probably relatives
10/13/22, 4:31 PM - Ryan: And the country agrees that the murder was righteous
10/13/22, 4:31 PM - Amritansh 2: Or just depends on the court/government
10/13/22, 4:31 PM - Ryan: None
10/13/22, 4:31 PM - Amritansh 2: That can't be..
10/13/22, 4:31 PM - Amritansh 2: Very far relatives
10/13/22, 4:32 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/13/22, 4:32 PM - Amritansh 2: Ye
10/13/22, 4:32 PM - Amritansh 2: Very repetitive
10/13/22, 4:32 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/13/22, 4:32 PM - Amritansh 2: Ok well bye
10/13/22, 4:32 PM - Amritansh 2: Gotta study
10/13/22, 4:33 PM - Amritansh 2: <Media omitted>
10/13/22, 4:33 PM - Ryan: üëåok
10/13/22, 4:33 PM - Amritansh 2: You gotta study
10/13/22, 4:34 PM - Amritansh 2: Quack
10/13/22, 4:34 PM - Ryan: ü¶Ü
10/13/22, 5:00 PM - Amritansh: <Media omitted>

10/13/22, 6:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: PIKACHU!!!
10/13/22, 6:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: they added Pikachu finally wow
10/13/22, 6:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: I mean i always play on 2 render distance so maybe it has always existed and im jsut blind
10/13/22, 6:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: probably this
10/13/22, 6:46 PM - Dev: It was always there
10/13/22, 6:46 PM - Dev: üòÉ

10/13/22, 8:26 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 Do you have any experience with Flame throwers or Fire?
10/13/22, 8:26 PM - Ryan: Any experiments with fire?
10/13/22, 8:26 PM - Navya: no
10/13/22, 8:26 PM - Navya: but seen
10/13/22, 8:26 PM - Ryan: Or any experience with corrosive acids?
10/13/22, 8:26 PM - Navya: sanitizer and fire
10/13/22, 8:26 PM - Navya: and also badam and fire
10/13/22, 8:26 PM - Navya: makes kajal
10/13/22, 8:27 PM - Ryan: Ok
10/13/22, 8:28 PM - Tanmaya: Arrival
10/13/22, 8:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/13/22, 8:28 PM - Tanmaya: 163 messages
10/13/22, 8:28 PM - Ryan: Nice

Would you like to take part in some experiments relating to fire?
10/13/22, 8:28 PM - Navya: hi
10/13/22, 8:28 PM - Navya: HELP
10/13/22, 8:29 PM - Navya: help I lost myself again
10/13/22, 8:29 PM - Navya: but I remember u
10/13/22, 8:29 PM - Navya: dont comeback
10/13/22, 8:29 PM - Navya: it wont end well
10/13/22, 8:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: But where

When

How
10/13/22, 8:29 PM - Navya: but I wish u would tell me too
10/13/22, 8:29 PM - Navya: OUR LOVE IS SIX FEET UNDER
10/13/22, 8:29 PM - Ryan: We will see
10/13/22, 8:29 PM - Navya: I CANT HELP BUT WONDER
10/13/22, 8:29 PM - Navya: IF OUR GRAVE
10/13/22, 8:29 PM - Navya: WAS WATER3D BY THE RAIN
10/13/22, 8:30 PM - Navya: WOULD ROSES BLOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMM
10/13/22, 8:30 PM - Navya: COULD ROSES BLOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
10/13/22, 8:30 PM - Navya: again?
10/13/22, 8:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: Rockets Propulsion üòÄ
10/13/22, 8:30 PM - Ryan: Weapon making

Sorry
10/13/22, 8:30 PM - Ryan: We can do that too
10/13/22, 8:30 PM - Navya: lmao
10/13/22, 8:30 PM - Navya: weapon making
10/13/22, 8:31 PM - Navya: ryan will commit an arson soon
10/13/22, 8:31 PM - Ryan: But that will require some chemistry as well well rocket science
10/13/22, 8:31 PM - Ryan: I am stupid in science
10/13/22, 8:31 PM - Navya: in school
10/13/22, 8:31 PM - Navya: u really hate our class dont u @919717944490
10/13/22, 8:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: rocket science is mildly easy üòÉ
rocket engineering is hard and dangerous ‚òπÔ∏è
10/13/22, 8:31 PM - Navya: what will u take in 11th?
10/13/22, 8:31 PM - Ryan: Probably I don't know

No experience
10/13/22, 8:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: start with pressure fed engines
10/13/22, 8:31 PM - Ryan: No boom yet
10/13/22, 8:32 PM - Ryan: No burn yet
10/13/22, 8:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: rockets can use no-boomy fuels üòÉ

but all the efficient ones are very very boomy and burn your skin eyes and lungs
10/13/22, 8:32 PM - Navya: üç™
10/13/22, 8:32 PM - Navya: üç™
10/13/22, 8:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: Don't spam
10/13/22, 8:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: Pleassseeee
10/13/22, 8:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: Mat karo
10/13/22, 8:32 PM - Navya: ok
10/13/22, 8:32 PM - Navya: ok
10/13/22, 8:33 PM - Ryan: Highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide can be used as a rocket fuel right?

Or a part of rocket fuel?
10/13/22, 8:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: potassium permanganate catalyst you require
10/13/22, 8:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: not immediately useful on its own
10/13/22, 8:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: or you could even just store something in COPV tanks with a valve
10/13/22, 8:34 PM - Ryan: We can get potassium permanganate

But would have to fight the strong urge to use it with sulfuric acid to create manganese heptoxide
10/13/22, 8:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: lmao yes
10/13/22, 8:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: h2o2 in rocket fuels is still quite dangerous
10/13/22, 8:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: as you need very high concentration for useful thrust
10/13/22, 8:35 PM - Ryan: Also one more problem is

We would likely die in the first attempt
10/13/22, 8:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/13/22, 8:36 PM - Ryan: We need to get persons and learn from their mistakes
10/13/22, 8:36 PM - Ryan: This message was deleted
10/13/22, 8:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: buddy
10/13/22, 8:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: what
10/13/22, 8:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: üòÄ
10/13/22, 8:37 PM - Ryan: Science
10/13/22, 8:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: also yeah many pioneers died
10/13/22, 8:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: a rocket is essentially a guided missile which is essentially a tin can with slow burning fuels with valves

max valier was the first fatality in modern rocketry
10/13/22, 8:38 PM - Ryan: How could we just do experiments while just knowing theory
10/13/22, 8:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: You can't
10/13/22, 8:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: India is not very permitting in that regard
10/13/22, 8:38 PM - Ryan: Yes

Kids couldn't even handle sodium hydroxide on their first experiment
10/13/22, 8:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: Even civilian drones have extreme regulations
10/13/22, 8:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: A certain person ate it
10/13/22, 8:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: Which makes the regulations reasonable
10/13/22, 8:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: @919717944490 your question for fire
10/13/22, 8:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i almost commited arson once
10/13/22, 8:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: anant remembere
10/13/22, 8:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: So as an amateur and a kid in India your only options are pressure fed engines

Later on you could potentially cook R-Candy
10/13/22, 8:40 PM - Ryan: üò∂
10/13/22, 8:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: or yes deodorant rocket
10/13/22, 8:41 PM - Ryan: Hmm
10/13/22, 8:42 PM - Ryan: Scientist reasoning

"If sodium hydroxide is a base, then it must taste bitter"

"Let me try it"
10/13/22, 8:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: ‚úÖ
10/13/22, 8:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: You deleted this message

10/13/22, 8:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: Have you tried the liquid oxygen separation apparatus experiment in the NCERT science book
10/13/22, 8:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: You can use as an oxidizer
10/13/22, 8:43 PM - Ryan: No

What page
10/13/22, 8:43 PM - Ryan: And it exists?
10/13/22, 8:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
10/13/22, 8:43 PM - Ryan: What class?
10/13/22, 8:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: 9
10/13/22, 8:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: 2nd chap of chemistry
10/13/22, 8:44 PM - Ryan: Oh I have not seen the 9th's science book

Only did the first chapter of the 10th science book
10/13/22, 8:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: <Media omitted>
10/13/22, 8:44 PM - Ryan: 2nd chapter of the 10ths science book is literally Acids,Bases and salts
10/13/22, 8:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: same as 7th
10/13/22, 8:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: but way more examples
10/13/22, 8:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: and as always no explanation üëçüëç
10/13/22, 8:45 PM - Ryan: And I think a little more detailed and some new topics I think
10/13/22, 8:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: olfactory indicators
acid / base + water solution reaction
various oxides
and pH
10/13/22, 8:46 PM - Ryan: Yes probably
10/13/22, 8:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: you should experiment with solid rocket fuels, more safer
10/13/22, 8:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: and just as illegal
10/13/22, 8:47 PM - Ryan: If it is boom enough, it is illegal
10/13/22, 8:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: üëç
10/13/22, 8:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: Run
10/13/22, 8:52 PM - Ryan: Do metals have a smell?
10/13/22, 8:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't thin so
10/13/22, 8:52 PM - Ryan: Ok
10/13/22, 8:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: i mean most of them have low vapor pressure so unlikely

but they still do smell for some reason

Probably directly nahi aa rahi hogi

10/13/22, 9:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: üòÉ
10/13/22, 9:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: but PTM
10/13/22, 9:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: gotta wake up Saturday
10/13/22, 9:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: my foot still not good so like
10/13/22, 9:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: im not going tmr probably
10/13/22, 9:02 PM - Dev: AAAAAA

10/13/22, 9:05 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ok buddy
10/13/22, 9:52 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?
10/13/22, 9:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
10/13/22, 9:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: Guess th√°
10/13/22, 9:52 PM - Ryan: Are metals volatile?

Mercury let's off some vapour, but it is odorless
10/13/22, 9:53 PM - Ryan: It may also depend on how the molecule reacts with the olfactory receptors I think
10/13/22, 9:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: I said most metals
10/13/22, 9:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yeah
10/13/22, 9:55 PM - Ryan: hmm low or no?
10/13/22, 9:55 PM - Ryan: What is vapor pressure exactly?

10/14/22, 9:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: Exactly
10/14/22, 9:26 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: modern problems require modern solutions
10/14/22, 9:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ

10/14/22, 9:26 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/14/22, 9:27 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: maybe someone who wants whats worse for other people
10/14/22, 9:27 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: exactly
10/14/22, 9:27 PM - Ryan: How am I supposed to judge if a person is evil or not if I don't know what is evil in detail
10/14/22, 9:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: But
10/14/22, 9:27 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: maybe maybe maybe
10/14/22, 9:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: Anyone can change that
10/14/22, 9:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: I mean we are biologically motivated to survive
10/14/22, 9:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: Given enough theoretical attempt
10/14/22, 9:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: And power
10/14/22, 9:27 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: true, obstacles
10/14/22, 9:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: And does survival care if it does evil
10/14/22, 9:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: Has our social conditioning really removed all evil
10/14/22, 9:28 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: No
10/14/22, 9:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: People who grow up in bad households
10/14/22, 9:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: They are not automatically good just because they are human
10/14/22, 9:28 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: trauma childhood
10/14/22, 9:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: Empathy is not observed in toddlers
10/14/22, 9:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/14/22, 9:28 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: toddler
10/14/22, 9:28 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: üòÄ
10/14/22, 9:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: Exactly
10/14/22, 9:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: So like
10/14/22, 9:28 PM - Ryan: Are you sure

Maybe someone wants other students to score less marks so that person could score 1st position

Is he evil? What is the extent of evil here?
10/14/22, 9:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: Is it really evil to do bad things so you can survive
10/14/22, 9:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: If they have been raised in a good environment
10/14/22, 9:28 PM - Navya: will the vdos and movies blank?
10/14/22, 9:29 PM - Ryan: That's why I don't know

What is evil?
10/14/22, 9:29 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: perhaps, isn't that somewhat jealousy?

part of it, maybe


maybe maybe maybe
10/14/22, 9:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: And some other factors and then they do that
10/14/22, 9:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: Then I think
10/14/22, 9:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: Maybe
10/14/22, 9:29 PM - Dev: This message was deleted
10/14/22, 9:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: Because its not necessary to get 1st for survival
10/14/22, 9:29 PM - Ryan: Yes that is jealousy

But it is also evil?
10/14/22, 9:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: In most cases it won't even help you
10/14/22, 9:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: Unless its JEE
10/14/22, 9:29 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: not necessarily, If needed
10/14/22, 9:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yeah
10/14/22, 9:29 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/14/22, 9:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yea but some people need
10/14/22, 9:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
10/14/22, 9:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: Infavt it's wrong
10/14/22, 9:29 PM - Navya: VDOS , PHOTOS AND STUFFS LIKE HHHHH MOVIEWS WILL BE DELETED IF I ADDA SOFTWARE IN IT?
@917838968821
10/14/22, 9:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: NO IT WON'T
10/14/22, 9:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: it literally won't
10/14/22, 9:29 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: what no
10/14/22, 9:29 PM - Ryan: 1st in exams not necessary

1st in all other skills may be necessary
10/14/22, 9:29 PM - Navya: really?
10/14/22, 9:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: why doesn't your phone lose all photos when you update whatsapp
10/14/22, 9:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: same reason
10/14/22, 9:30 PM - Dev: No
10/14/22, 9:30 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: 2nd line, very true
10/14/22, 9:30 PM - Dev: Kyu
10/14/22, 9:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: , so whenever I install a program on my laptop, do you think i have to delete all 70k screenshots i have on laptop?
10/14/22, 9:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: No I don't
10/14/22, 9:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: Kuch nahi hoga
10/14/22, 9:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: If you install it from correct website
10/14/22, 9:30 PM - Navya: how to add a software in laptop
10/14/22, 9:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: Then literally nothing can happen unless your computer has malware or something, your router is misconfigured and it somehow messes up
10/14/22, 9:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: Try your best
10/14/22, 9:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: What is the greatest advent of the 21st century
10/14/22, 9:31 PM - Navya: chaup
10/14/22, 9:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: I'd argue the internet

Guess what you can ask the Internet
10/14/22, 9:31 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 is there any child in 8th you consider evil
10/14/22, 9:31 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: 1st line also very true but for how long are you going to score 1st in school?

one day you'll complete school, now what?
10/14/22, 9:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: Nahi help karne waala
10/14/22, 9:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: cope karlo
10/14/22, 9:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: Literally google "python download"
10/14/22, 9:31 PM - Navya: ü¶∂üèªü¶∂üèªü¶∂üèªü¶∂üèª
10/14/22, 9:31 PM - Ryan: Then college
10/14/22, 9:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: Mam even sent a document in group on how to do it, but chalo koi nahi if you haven't seen
10/14/22, 9:31 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: college includes education üëçüèª
10/14/22, 9:31 PM - Navya: I have to connect internet with ohoeen before
10/14/22, 9:31 PM - Ryan: üëç
10/14/22, 9:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/14/22, 9:31 PM - Navya: I am not doing
10/14/22, 9:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: That's true
10/14/22, 9:32 PM - Navya: I will do tomorrow
10/14/22, 9:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: To karlo
10/14/22, 9:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ok
10/14/22, 9:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ok
10/14/22, 9:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: So you are procrastinating and not trying your best
10/14/22, 9:32 PM - Navya: tomoddow
10/14/22, 9:32 PM - Ryan: @919999373163 any child you consider evil in 8th
10/14/22, 9:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: Understandable
10/14/22, 9:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: Have a great day
10/14/22, 9:32 PM - Navya: toddrow
10/14/22, 9:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: Anant
10/14/22, 9:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: Darash
10/14/22, 9:32 PM - Navya: üëÉüèª
10/14/22, 9:32 PM - Navya: yes
10/14/22, 9:32 PM - Navya: him
10/14/22, 9:32 PM - Navya: and him
10/14/22, 9:32 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: I do, I have talked with almost everyone in 8th üëçüèª
10/14/22, 9:33 PM - Ryan: almost
10/14/22, 9:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: tbh you don't need to be first in everything to live a life where you can live long enough to reproduce

And evolution wants you to somehow survive as long as possible
10/14/22, 9:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: But is jealousy induced by evolution
10/14/22, 9:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: Evolution hasn't ever strived to be perfect
10/14/22, 9:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: It's randomness with a bit of natural selection guidance afterall
10/14/22, 9:33 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?
10/14/22, 9:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/14/22, 9:33 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: almost yes, maybe 10-20 people
10/14/22, 9:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: Evolution tries to make you live long enough
10/14/22, 9:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: To have babies
10/14/22, 9:34 PM - Ryan: I think evolution strives to be perfect, but it is too slow
10/14/22, 9:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: If you don't live long enough, no babies, so less of the gene pool is comprised of your genes
10/14/22, 9:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: Huh
10/14/22, 9:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: I guess
10/14/22, 9:34 PM - Ryan: To slow to adapt to new conditions
10/14/22, 9:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: Because still most animals die before they manage to make more of themselves
10/14/22, 9:34 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: will the human race ever stop reproducing
10/14/22, 9:34 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/14/22, 9:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: And to die less you'll have to be more perfect
10/14/22, 9:35 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ah yes
10/14/22, 9:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: But perfect in specific ways
10/14/22, 9:35 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: guhhh?!?!?!?!!!?!
10/14/22, 9:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: And thats not truly perfect then
10/14/22, 9:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/14/22, 9:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: We will die
10/14/22, 9:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: You are about to die
10/14/22, 9:35 PM - Navya: null
10/14/22, 9:35 PM - Navya: null
10/14/22, 9:35 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: sorry
10/14/22, 9:35 PM - Navya: ü§ìü¶∂üèª
10/14/22, 9:35 PM - Navya: no
10/14/22, 9:36 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: name can you dm @919599326953
10/14/22, 9:36 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?
10/14/22, 9:36 PM - Navya: no
10/14/22, 9:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/14/22, 9:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
10/14/22, 9:36 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: "if" we (the human race) stops reproducing


IF
10/14/22, 9:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: The universe may end
10/14/22, 9:36 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: üòÇ
10/14/22, 9:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: Vsauce has a video called "If"
10/14/22, 9:36 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: watched I have
10/14/22, 9:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: Good
10/14/22, 9:36 PM - Amritansh: Nice English!
10/14/22, 9:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: fun fact the thumbnail of that video is probably the Vega C first stage srb
10/14/22, 9:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: he missed that launch
10/14/22, 9:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: shut up detergent
10/14/22, 9:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: and the exhaust is definitely of an SRB

so my guess

10/14/22, 9:37 PM - Amritansh: This message was deleted

10/14/22, 9:37 PM - Amritansh: You are detergent
10/14/22, 9:37 PM - Amritansh: I am dishes
10/14/22, 9:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: I claim to think that the chances are high
10/14/22, 9:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ok buddy
10/14/22, 9:37 PM - Amritansh: You clean me üòéüòé
10/14/22, 9:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: ...
10/14/22, 9:38 PM - Ryan: Ok
10/14/22, 9:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: other natural disasters?
10/14/22, 9:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: or what
10/14/22, 9:38 PM - Amritansh: <Media omitted>
10/14/22, 9:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: Is the universe ending a natural disaster
10/14/22, 9:38 PM - Ryan: Natural death just?
10/14/22, 9:38 PM - Ryan: Probably
10/14/22, 9:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: no like the whole race
10/14/22, 9:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: perhaps
10/14/22, 9:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: A disaster is a bad calamity

Universe ending cannot be considered bad because bad is a human emotion

I mean, considering? That means, my perspective on it, right?

So I _consider_ it to be bad

Might not be the true nature, the true reality, if there is one
10/14/22, 9:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: Thog don't care.
10/14/22, 9:39 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: you won't consider the universe ending to be bad because you'll be dead till then
10/14/22, 9:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/14/22, 9:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: I consider it now to be bad
10/14/22, 9:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: 8 minutes from now
10/14/22, 9:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: I will probably not have a future consideration on that event
10/14/22, 9:40 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?

That you consider it to be bad

Will you continue considering it to be bad?
10/14/22, 9:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: But for now, I consider

That's the common meaning of consider, isn't it?
10/14/22, 9:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: Exactly
10/14/22, 9:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: you'll just Panik
10/14/22, 9:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: I might not
10/14/22, 9:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: But
10/14/22, 9:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: I am using the word to describe the present
10/14/22, 9:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: This
10/14/22, 9:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: 7
10/14/22, 9:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: I mean you are going to die
10/14/22, 9:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: You too
10/14/22, 9:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: Probably
10/14/22, 9:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: If the universe ends
10/14/22, 9:42 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: why consider it to be bad if it may happen? "MAYBE" ü§®
"I don't like the idea of the universe endi-" *insert earth exploding*
10/14/22, 9:42 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: exactly lol
10/14/22, 9:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: minor inconvenience
10/14/22, 9:42 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: hahahhaa yesb
10/14/22, 9:42 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
10/14/22, 9:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: "if it may happen" that again is a question of the future
You are talking about it from a potential perspective of you being in the future

I am talking about right now
10/14/22, 9:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: THIS IS FROM UNIVERSE SANDBOX¬≤
10/14/22, 9:42 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: hmm

10/15/22, 2:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: Sanskrit and English pretty bad
10/15/22, 2:42 PM - Ryan: Oh

Are you sure?

Is it really bad? What do you consider bad
10/15/22, 2:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: üòÄ
10/15/22, 2:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: <Media omitted>
10/15/22, 2:45 PM - Ryan: Well atleast term-1 ended

Nothing can be done now (I don't know, can really nothing be done now?)
10/15/22, 2:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: you can donate to children who are from poor families
10/15/22, 2:46 PM - Ryan: Why?
10/15/22, 2:46 PM - Ryan: Because it is good?
10/15/22, 2:46 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: wow
10/15/22, 2:46 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: isn't it?
10/15/22, 2:47 PM - Ryan: How?
10/15/22, 2:47 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ok buddy
10/15/22, 2:48 PM - Ryan: Because the poor who have to deal with a lot of problems to meet their daily needs could get some relief?
10/15/22, 2:49 PM - Ryan: Why only children? Why not adults?

Why not donate to everybody? It will help everyone in some way right?
10/15/22, 2:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: Because I don't care about them
10/15/22, 2:49 PM - Ryan: But I will suffer then
10/15/22, 2:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yay
10/15/22, 2:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: I mean
10/15/22, 2:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes we should donate
10/15/22, 2:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: üëç
10/15/22, 2:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: not necessarily
10/15/22, 2:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: some donations may not be used properly
10/15/22, 2:50 PM - Ryan: For people I don't even know, for people I can't even relate with
10/15/22, 2:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: you may be supporting evil businesses
10/15/22, 2:51 PM - Ryan: I have never struggled like they did

I should be happy and satisfied right? I should be grateful right?

But are we grateful?
10/15/22, 2:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: Depends
10/15/22, 2:51 PM - Ryan: I think many of us are not grateful
10/15/22, 2:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: I am, everytime I eat food I understand how it's much better than what most people get to eat so
10/15/22, 2:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: Fair
10/15/22, 2:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: But this is partially grateful
10/15/22, 2:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: I am not grateful about everything
10/15/22, 2:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't think most people are
10/15/22, 2:52 PM - Ryan: But do you eat the food completely
10/15/22, 2:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: Why do we get angry

Is that being ungrateful?
10/15/22, 2:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/15/22, 2:52 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?
10/15/22, 2:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: If I don't eat lunch I'll eat at home
10/15/22, 2:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: or atleast my mom eats it
10/15/22, 2:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: Or kisi or ko offer
10/15/22, 2:52 PM - Ryan: You make her eat it

Because she doesn't want to waste food
10/15/22, 2:52 PM - Ryan: This is sad
10/15/22, 2:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/15/22, 2:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: i don't want to either
10/15/22, 2:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: So i get someone to eat it
10/15/22, 2:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: Not the best thing but better than throwing away
10/15/22, 2:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: because food is useful, i think
10/15/22, 2:53 PM - Ryan: So you are not grateful?
10/15/22, 2:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: I CLAIM THAT FOOD IS USEFUL
10/15/22, 2:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: what?
10/15/22, 2:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: i don't want to waste food either
10/15/22, 2:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: she doesn't want to waste food either
10/15/22, 2:53 PM - Ryan: Are you sure

Is over-eating better than wasting that food?
10/15/22, 2:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: we are grateful for it's existence so we eat it somehow
10/15/22, 2:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: It is not better
10/15/22, 2:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: We store it for later
10/15/22, 2:54 PM - Ryan: The desire only is useless

Action is also needed
10/15/22, 2:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: If we can't eat now
10/15/22, 2:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes and the action is being done
10/15/22, 2:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: It's not getting thrown away as much as possible
10/15/22, 2:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: I eat it later or someone else eats it later
10/15/22, 2:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: Is that not action?
10/15/22, 2:55 PM - Ryan: Someone else eats it

That part

Do they want to eat it? Do they like eating it? Do they need to eat it
10/15/22, 2:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yea almost always
10/15/22, 2:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: There are 4 problem
10/15/22, 2:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: People*
10/15/22, 2:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: One of them can eat, one of them may want to eat atleast
10/15/22, 2:56 PM - Ryan: Wouldn't you just waste the food

Rather than eating extra-food everyday than your required needs

Chances of developing weight, getting over-weight?
10/15/22, 2:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: extra food? everyday?
10/15/22, 2:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: everyday??
10/15/22, 2:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: and how much extra that I start getting health problems?
10/15/22, 2:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: none of that happens
10/15/22, 2:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: so wasting is not a better option
10/15/22, 2:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: In this case
10/15/22, 2:57 PM - Ryan: Are you sure not everyday?
10/15/22, 2:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: for us
10/15/22, 2:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: üòÄ
10/15/22, 2:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: i just said that üòÉ
10/15/22, 2:57 PM - Ryan: Oh

Good

Or is it?
10/15/22, 2:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: we don't, we work to waste as little as possible
10/15/22, 2:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes it is good it does not affect our health and it saves food and money
10/15/22, 2:57 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?
10/15/22, 2:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: bigger bang for the buck
10/15/22, 2:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/15/22, 2:57 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?
10/15/22, 2:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: YES
10/15/22, 2:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes*
10/15/22, 2:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: I am going to eat food right now üòÄ
10/15/22, 2:58 PM - Ryan: Ok
10/15/22, 2:58 PM - Ryan: Be sure to eat it all
10/15/22, 2:58 PM - Ryan: Atleast try to
10/15/22, 2:59 PM - Ryan: Because at the trip, I was heavily disappointed with the children


THEY EVEN WASTED PIZZA
10/15/22, 3:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/15/22, 3:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: WHAT
10/15/22, 3:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: i would beat them right there
10/15/22, 3:11 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: what haww

10/15/22, 3:24 PM - Ryan: That is a crime
10/15/22, 3:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: Update: I have ate it all
10/15/22, 3:28 PM - Ryan: üòÄ

10/15/22, 4:41 PM - Ryan: The resolution of Electron microscope is greater than light microscope right?
10/15/22, 4:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
10/15/22, 4:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: much much greater
10/15/22, 4:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: you can't see most bacteria with optical microscope

10/15/22, 4:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: OH GOD
10/15/22, 4:42 PM - Ryan: Is it because the accelerated electrons have a very less wavelength, less than visible light and as resolution also kind of depends on refractive index and refractive index decreases with increase in wavelength, the electron microscope has much better resolution?

Just confirming
10/15/22, 4:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: I'VE HEARD THAT

10/16/22, 10:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: or was it a coincidence
10/16/22, 10:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: coincidence? I think not
10/16/22, 10:43 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: biggest coincidence is me being inside your house

10/16/22, 10:45 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i know how it feels
10/16/22, 10:45 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: that morning annoyance and realization
10/16/22, 10:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
10/16/22, 10:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: 5 days
10/16/22, 10:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: school
10/16/22, 10:45 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: but on weekends and holidays it isnt there so it feels good to relax
10/16/22, 10:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: of which ill probably be absent for 3
10/16/22, 10:45 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: but school nb work so no relax

10/16/22, 10:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: i hate you both
10/16/22, 10:47 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: EYSSS BROO
10/16/22, 10:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: don't send it anywhere
10/16/22, 10:48 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: im on phone so uhhh
10/16/22, 10:48 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i dont have
10/16/22, 10:48 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: im not on* phon
10/16/22, 10:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: have you ever wondered how coke is used in steel production
10/16/22, 10:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: or did you just memorize that fact aswell
10/16/22, 10:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: do you think you'll remember it in an year
10/16/22, 10:49 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: you fucking idiot, you're making me question the education
10/16/22, 10:49 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i wont remember it any day after an year
10/16/22, 10:49 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: or after the exam for this chapter
10/16/22, 10:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: well steel is an alloy of iron and something right?

how do you get that iron from the rock?

by heating, to get rid of the rock

but high temperatures cause o¬≤ to break down I think

so the iron reacts with the oxygen and forms iron(iii) oxides
10/16/22, 10:50 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: they don't teach us that rn
10/16/22, 10:50 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: they only teach where it is used
10/16/22, 10:50 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: not how
10/16/22, 10:50 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: why is that so
10/16/22, 10:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: so we can write the reaction as CO + Fe¬≤O¬≥ -> Fe + CO¬≤

you can see how in LHS the iron is in form of iron oxide
10/16/22, 10:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: but in RHS, it is broken down into simply elemental iron
10/16/22, 10:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: ie no more oxygen binded to the iron
10/16/22, 10:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: üòÉüëèüèª
10/16/22, 10:51 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ah yes mathematics in science
10/16/22, 10:51 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i know it exists shut the fuck up
10/16/22, 10:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: if you balance it then it's 3CO + Fe¬≤O¬≥ -> 2Fe + 3CO¬≤
10/16/22, 10:51 PM - Aditya Vardhan: no
10/16/22, 10:51 PM - Aditya Vardhan: just nubers
10/16/22, 10:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: So you get iron and carbon dioxide
10/16/22, 10:51 PM - Aditya Vardhan: what is valency
10/16/22, 10:51 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: valorant
10/16/22, 10:51 PM - Aditya Vardhan: abhi tak nahi pta
10/16/22, 10:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: how much something wants to fill it's outermost shell
10/16/22, 10:51 PM - Aditya Vardhan: mujhe
10/16/22, 10:51 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: why every word that starts with val makes me think of valoant
10/16/22, 10:51 PM - Aditya Vardhan: in chemistry its something different right
10/16/22, 10:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: but why is coke used to produce the carbon monoxide
10/16/22, 10:52 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: for example valorant
10/16/22, 10:52 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: fuck
10/16/22, 10:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: nahi
10/16/22, 10:52 PM - Aditya Vardhan: yes i think
10/16/22, 10:52 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: if you think too much it will seem sus
10/16/22, 10:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: valence shell outermost electron shell
valence electrons electrons in valence shell
10/16/22, 10:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: valency number of electrons required to fill octet
10/16/22, 10:52 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ah yes
10/16/22, 10:52 PM - Aditya Vardhan: no dont overthink
10/16/22, 10:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: ok
10/16/22, 10:53 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: already hogaya, mutthi bhi nikaal li
10/16/22, 10:53 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: too late
10/16/22, 10:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: ryan please help
10/16/22, 10:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: why is coke used here
10/16/22, 10:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: you just need carbon monoxide right?
10/16/22, 10:53 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: probably gonna reply with idk
10/16/22, 10:53 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: or idk
10/16/22, 10:53 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: or idk
10/16/22, 10:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: please don't
10/16/22, 10:54 PM - Ryan: I don't know
10/16/22, 10:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: WHAT
10/16/22, 10:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: HOLY SHIT HE'S THERE
10/16/22, 10:54 PM - Aditya Vardhan: what are radicals
10/16/22, 10:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: a symbol
10/16/22, 10:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: commonly used for positive square root
10/16/22, 10:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: in chemistry something else
10/16/22, 10:55 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: I TOLD YOU LMAO
10/16/22, 10:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: i think in bonds where some of the valence electrons are not bonded, so the molecules sharing that are the radicals
10/16/22, 10:55 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: the chances of ryan replying to your question with "idk" are wayy too highh
10/16/22, 10:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: but never too high
10/16/22, 10:55 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: @919717944490 do you know
10/16/22, 10:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: What is to know?
10/16/22, 10:56 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: also anant notice how you did not ping ryan but he still came lol
10/16/22, 10:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: What is the difference between information and knowledge
10/16/22, 10:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/16/22, 10:56 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: there is a lot to know, but only to a limit our brain can handle
10/16/22, 10:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: Or did I
10/16/22, 10:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: What exactly is this limit? Why does it exist
10/16/22, 10:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: i am doing methamphetamine
10/16/22, 10:56 PM - Aditya Vardhan: what are compounds
10/16/22, 10:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: or am I
10/16/22, 10:56 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: we gain knowledge by understanding information
10/16/22, 10:57 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: limit is dementia

10/16/22, 10:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: @919454835401 hope this helps
10/16/22, 10:58 PM - Aditya Vardhan: solids have 0
10/16/22, 10:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: not 0
10/16/22, 10:58 PM - Aditya Vardhan: yes
10/16/22, 10:58 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: uses of coke
10/16/22, 10:58 PM - Aditya Vardhan: its written "no compressibility" so i thinnk no=0
10/16/22, 10:59 PM - Aditya Vardhan: drughuhg
10/16/22, 10:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: How do you measure compressibility?
10/16/22, 10:59 PM - Aditya Vardhan: boom goes exploser
10/16/22, 10:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: 0 what? How can you claim that compressibility can be represented by dimensionless units?
10/16/22, 10:59 PM - Aditya Vardhan: hydraulic press se compress kardo
10/16/22, 10:59 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: @917838968821 if the so what formula in this chapter wasnt taught then why did you write
10/16/22, 10:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: so what does it measure
10/16/22, 10:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: the number on the display
10/16/22, 10:59 PM - Aditya Vardhan: what weight it takes to destroy
10/16/22, 11:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: are you sure
10/16/22, 11:00 PM - Aditya Vardhan: what force
10/16/22, 11:00 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: null
10/16/22, 11:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: more accurate
10/16/22, 11:00 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: HAHHAHAHHA I MADE A YOUR MOM JOKE LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
sorry guys im in desperate need of help please forgive
10/16/22, 11:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: and how does the force help you measure compressibility here

you can make the observation but there must be a mathematical way to do it
10/16/22, 11:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
10/16/22, 11:00 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: okay guys i shall sleep now

10/18/22, 8:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: Depends

10/18/22, 8:38 PM - Ryan: I am probably the stupidest in the class
10/18/22, 8:38 PM - Dev: This message was deleted
10/18/22, 8:38 PM - Dev: In the indian society
10/18/22, 8:38 PM - Dev: More marks = better the student
10/18/22, 8:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: People can't go in detail every person

So that's why exams exist
10/18/22, 8:38 PM - Dev: Better the student = better the job
10/18/22, 8:38 PM - Ryan: Why Job

Crime
10/18/22, 8:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: Or more marks = better cheater / better memorizer
10/18/22, 8:38 PM - Dev: Better the job = better the person
10/18/22, 8:39 PM - Dev: Some times it is not that
10/18/22, 8:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/18/22, 8:39 PM - Ryan: Probably
10/18/22, 8:39 PM - Dev: Some times a student actually studies?
10/18/22, 8:39 PM - Dev: ü§®
10/18/22, 8:39 PM - Dev: Thursday will be fun
10/18/22, 8:39 PM - Dev: Only math ssc and PE
10/18/22, 8:40 PM - Dev: And watching match
10/18/22, 8:40 PM - Dev: üòÉ
10/18/22, 8:40 PM - Ryan: But the cheaters couldn't score the highest marks
10/18/22, 8:40 PM - Dev: Or run
10/18/22, 8:40 PM - Dev: <Media omitted>
10/18/22, 8:40 PM - Dev: Yes
10/18/22, 8:40 PM - Ryan: They failed
10/18/22, 8:40 PM - Dev: Do you know any cheater that failed
10/18/22, 8:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: marks

Sanskrit:
do I know it? No
can I memorize what sir tells? Yes

English:
do i know it? yes
can i write the literature answers with exact same points as the ones mam discussed in class? No because I don't want to memorize

but I got pretty much the same in both of them
10/18/22, 8:40 PM - Ryan: I don't know
10/18/22, 8:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: Marks are stupid
10/18/22, 8:41 PM - Dev: Yes
10/18/22, 8:41 PM - Dev: Someone was caught cheating in the paper of coding and had to give an retehst
10/18/22, 8:41 PM - Dev: I thino
10/18/22, 8:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: For many, it teaches us to workaround the system instead of being more productive
10/18/22, 8:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yea..
10/18/22, 8:41 PM - Dev: Marks are stupid
10/18/22, 8:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: I think part of this problem is why do we have to study THREE languages
10/18/22, 8:41 PM - Dev: Like if you study much and don't do well
10/18/22, 8:42 PM - Ryan: Study
10/18/22, 8:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: Study?
10/18/22, 8:42 PM - Dev: Less confidence
10/18/22, 8:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: We have them to study them
10/18/22, 8:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yeah
10/18/22, 8:42 PM - Ryan: It's probably just that you don't want to study Sanskrit
10/18/22, 8:42 PM - Dev: Yeah it stupie
10/18/22, 8:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
10/18/22, 8:42 PM - Ryan: Maybe should have chosen another language
10/18/22, 8:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: because for most people it's not useful
10/18/22, 8:42 PM - Dev: Same with me but french
10/18/22, 8:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: is French any more useful?
10/18/22, 8:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
10/18/22, 8:42 PM - Dev: No
10/18/22, 8:42 PM - Dev: It's not
10/18/22, 8:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: if you go to france
10/18/22, 8:42 PM - Ryan: Une Baguette S'il vous plait
10/18/22, 8:43 PM - Dev: No
10/18/22, 8:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: or a french speaking country
10/18/22, 8:43 PM - Dev: Just teacher us how to write
10/18/22, 8:43 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/18/22, 8:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/18/22, 8:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: Or read
10/18/22, 8:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: That's kind of useful
10/18/22, 8:43 PM - Ryan: Barely any knowledge of pronunciation
10/18/22, 8:43 PM - Dev: I think we have not learned any pronunciation in 8th or 7th and maybe also 6th
10/18/22, 8:43 PM - Dev: Teaches*
10/18/22, 8:43 PM - Dev: Yes
10/18/22, 8:43 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/18/22, 8:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: But you can get around France knowing basic French to read signs and stuff. Then speak in English or use translator
10/18/22, 8:44 PM - Dev: Yes, I am pretty sure
10/18/22, 8:44 PM - Dev: You learn French if you want to go to France
10/18/22, 8:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: And in case of learning language structures, we already have Hindi and English grammar for that
10/18/22, 8:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/18/22, 8:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: Take a course
10/18/22, 8:44 PM - Dev: What are the chances?
10/18/22, 8:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: Low
10/18/22, 8:44 PM - Dev: You will end up in feance
10/18/22, 8:45 PM - Ryan: Nous sommes Les Hommes de banana

Pronounce
10/18/22, 8:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: Brain gets much worse at learning languages after an age threshold

And 4th class was precisely after that age threshold
10/18/22, 8:45 PM - Dev: Which has more posinous blood
King cobra or black mamba
10/18/22, 8:45 PM - Dev: @917838968821 @919717944490
10/18/22, 8:45 PM - Ryan: Black mamba probably
10/18/22, 8:45 PM - Dev: *venom
10/18/22, 8:45 PM - Dev: How?
10/18/22, 8:45 PM - Ryan: But sea snakes are even more venomous
10/18/22, 8:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: So the difference between your learning French in 4th vs French 3 months before you're going to France is not that insane
10/18/22, 8:46 PM - Ryan: Nat Geo Wild
10/18/22, 8:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: üòÉ
10/18/22, 8:46 PM - Dev: Lol
10/18/22, 8:46 PM - Dev: I remebr watching that
10/18/22, 8:46 PM - Dev: Snapping turtles are kind weird
10/18/22, 8:46 PM - Dev: Kind of*
10/18/22, 8:46 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/18/22, 8:46 PM - Dev: Yes
10/18/22, 8:46 PM - Dev: They look like turtle
10/18/22, 8:46 PM - Dev: But have different heads
10/18/22, 8:47 PM - Dev: Not like normal turtles
10/18/22, 8:47 PM - Ryan: What about softshell turtles
10/18/22, 8:47 PM - Dev: Weird too
10/18/22, 8:47 PM - Ryan: Probably
10/18/22, 8:48 PM - Dev: Tiger be stronger than lions
10/18/22, 8:48 PM - Dev: Lion cringe
10/18/22, 8:48 PM - Ryan: Truly
10/18/22, 8:48 PM - Dev: But no one stronker than monke

10/18/22, 8:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: Do you guys think the revision we generally do is useless
10/18/22, 8:49 PM - Ryan: Would you like to learn about Travis the chimpazee
10/18/22, 8:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/18/22, 8:49 PM - Ryan: I don't know
10/18/22, 8:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: I would like to
10/18/22, 8:50 PM - Ryan: Google search "Travis the chimps victim"
10/18/22, 8:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: Damn so Ig a serial killer monkey
10/18/22, 8:52 PM - Ryan: Not serial killer

But Chimpanzee being Chimpanzee
10/18/22, 8:56 PM - Ryan: Many incidents related to animals and humans are horrific
10/18/22, 8:57 PM - Ryan: Animals being animals
10/18/22, 8:57 PM - Dev: Travis the chimpanzee dos enough look happy
10/18/22, 8:58 PM - Dev: Travis ripped her face off
10/18/22, 8:59 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/18/22, 8:59 PM - Ryan: And also the Timothy Treadwell case
10/18/22, 8:59 PM - Ryan: Horrifying
10/18/22, 9:04 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i hope so, thanks for the expectation
10/18/22, 9:04 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: oh hey 2.3 again?
10/18/22, 9:04 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: for math
10/18/22, 9:15 PM - Ryan: <Media omitted>
10/18/22, 9:15 PM - Ryan: Any step missing?
10/18/22, 9:17 PM - Dev: No
10/18/22, 9:17 PM - Dev: It's the right solution
10/18/22, 9:17 PM - Ryan: üòÄ
10/18/22, 9:18 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: are you screaming
10/18/22, 9:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: Sahi hai
10/18/22, 9:25 PM - Ryan: Was there any other homework given to us today
10/18/22, 9:26 PM - Ryan: @917838968821
10/18/22, 9:26 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: no, no i dont think so
10/18/22, 9:26 PM - Ryan: Ok
10/18/22, 9:46 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: @919717944490 do i have to learn all the past participle forms for french
10/18/22, 9:46 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: irregular to P.P
10/18/22, 9:50 PM - Ryan: Probably
10/18/22, 9:51 PM - Ryan: Three of them have the same past participle I think

"Plu"
10/18/22, 9:54 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: haha yeah
10/18/22, 9:54 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: is that a yes
10/18/22, 9:54 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i mean im guessing so
10/18/22, 9:54 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: it probably is
10/18/22, 9:55 PM - Ryan: Memorizing them would be tough
10/18/22, 9:55 PM - Ryan: Would first try by using them in sentences
10/18/22, 9:56 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ah yes
10/18/22, 9:56 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: sentences as in

Is calcium carbonate porous?

@917838968821

Porous enough for air to pass
10/19/22, 4:28 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: you have big brain
10/19/22, 4:28 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: üëç
10/19/22, 4:28 PM - Ryan: No
10/19/22, 4:28 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?
10/19/22, 4:29 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yes I am
10/19/22, 4:31 PM - Navya: yes
10/19/22, 4:31 PM - Navya: Ryan : ok
ryan in exams : BUG BRAIN TIME
10/19/22, 4:32 PM - Ryan: And also I have one more doubt

The thing we made today in STEM lab period

Is it really good enough to filter gas released from the exhaust of vehicles(probably just the unburnt carbon particles)

And will it allow sufficient passing of the gas

I am worried about the disk (I don't know if this is the right word ) with calcium carbonate (calcium hydroxide reacts with carbon dioxide in the air to form calcium carbonate probably)

And also the unburnt carbon particles would collect overtime

Making the filter useless

Is it really that useful?
10/19/22, 4:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: What no?
10/19/22, 4:33 PM - Ryan: So the filter isn't efficient
10/19/22, 4:33 PM - Ryan: ?
10/19/22, 4:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: I've not made it
10/19/22, 4:33 PM - Ryan: Or is it
10/19/22, 4:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: Probably not. School ka project hai, model scale. Probably to show working on a very low efficiency scale
10/19/22, 4:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: But I haven't made myself so I can't tell
10/19/22, 4:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: As I was absent
10/19/22, 4:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: BUG BRAIN? lmao
10/19/22, 4:34 PM - Ryan: Yes be bee
10/19/22, 4:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: Good idea
10/19/22, 4:36 PM - Ryan: What are the chances that some students consumed some calcium hydroxide
10/19/22, 4:36 PM - Navya: https://youtube.com/shorts/QqEEaJSxSLs?feature=share
10/19/22, 4:37 PM - Ryan: When water climbs the upwards when it comes into contact with a tissue or paper defying gravity, what is the force in play here that is stronger than the force of gravity?
10/19/22, 4:37 PM - Ryan: @917838968821
10/19/22, 4:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ohhh so that's what I was missing. I should eat chai biscuit but shave it's edges by a machine so that it fits in the cup. Thanks for the advice
10/19/22, 4:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: High
10/19/22, 4:40 PM - Navya: welcome
10/19/22, 4:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: I am not sure

Small amount of water absorbed by paper by condensation or small contact, and then cohesive forces pull more? Just my guess
10/19/22, 4:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: The observation is not that large scale so kinda confusing
10/19/22, 4:42 PM - Ryan: And also, have you got the answers for the previous questions
10/19/22, 4:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: Where
10/19/22, 4:46 PM - Dev: Hm
10/19/22, 4:46 PM - Dev: Tomorrow will be fun
10/19/22, 4:46 PM - Dev: PE  and sports day

10/19/22, 6:07 PM - Ryan: And how would i write an answer that is only 4-5 lines long

That would just contain the translation

Wouldn't it?

Any study happened today (if you want to school today)
10/20/22, 2:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: aditya and i did not go
10/20/22, 2:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: and literally kuch nahi hua it was a sports meet day
10/20/22, 2:37 PM - Ryan: I don't know

If I miss any class I would probably fail
10/20/22, 2:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: No you wouldn't
10/20/22, 2:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: You literally would not
10/20/22, 2:38 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/20/22, 2:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: Why do you think not going to one class will make you lose 70% of your marks causing you to fail? You literally won't. If you got 0 in every subject in Term - 2, you'd still get 48.4% overall marks, so like how will you even fail
10/20/22, 2:40 PM - Dev: Hello
10/20/22, 2:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: Most of the classes don't even add any new information which we couldn't have gotten from reading the chapter or googling about it
10/20/22, 2:40 PM - Ryan: How did the race go
10/20/22, 2:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: BUDDDDY
10/20/22, 2:40 PM - Ryan: Probably
10/20/22, 2:41 PM - Ryan: But I am stupid
10/20/22, 2:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: How so
10/20/22, 2:41 PM - Dev: Well
10/20/22, 2:41 PM - Ryan: Can you prove i am not stupid?
10/20/22, 2:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
10/20/22, 2:41 PM - Ryan: Oh no
10/20/22, 2:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: What is to be stupid

You don't do either of these so you're probably not stupid

10/20/22, 2:46 PM - Ryan: Nice
10/20/22, 2:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: you must have plotted position on distance-time graph and found derivative of a taylor series to calculate this

10/20/22, 3:44 PM - Aditya Vardhan: why do you think like this
10/20/22, 3:45 PM - Aditya Vardhan: that you will fail
10/20/22, 3:45 PM - Aditya Vardhan: huh
10/20/22, 3:45 PM - Aditya Vardhan: you scored 99.29
10/20/22, 3:45 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: Ryan moment üëç
10/20/22, 3:45 PM - Aditya Vardhan: is that not enough
10/20/22, 3:45 PM - Aditya Vardhan: imagine how i am existing even after scoring lower that 50 percent in french
10/20/22, 3:46 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: can't think about me
10/20/22, 3:46 PM - Navya: wtf
10/20/22, 3:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes it's so unnecessary like it just won't happen
10/20/22, 3:50 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/20/22, 3:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: Are you sure?
10/20/22, 3:51 PM - Ryan: No
10/20/22, 3:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: Exactly
10/20/22, 3:51 PM - Ryan: Or am i
10/20/22, 3:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: "probably"
10/20/22, 3:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: You wrote probably, so I assume not
10/20/22, 3:51 PM - Ryan: Ok
10/20/22, 3:53 PM - Ryan: I don't know

I got those marks maybe because coincidence that I knew almost everything that came in the exam
10/20/22, 3:53 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: @919717944490 you were in my dream today haha
10/20/22, 3:53 PM - Amritansh: Lol
10/20/22, 3:53 PM - Ryan: hmn
10/20/22, 3:54 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: you had 3 twins, you all looked the same
10/20/22, 3:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: Binary fission successful?
10/20/22, 3:54 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: üò≥ BROOO
10/20/22, 3:55 PM - Ryan: Is getting marks really useful
10/20/22, 3:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
10/20/22, 3:56 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: No
10/20/22, 3:56 PM - Ryan: Too much marks and teachers start expecting good marks and interaction from you, why?

Too less marks and you get bullied by the teachers themselves
10/20/22, 3:57 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: are you sure bullied is the right word?
10/20/22, 3:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: Get over 90 or 95 and call it a day

The content taught to us is not useful

Exam questions test if you can write down key points and shit

But most of the time the answers are very stretched and useless

You will forget the useless points after a while
10/20/22, 3:57 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: maybe teachers want better for us
10/20/22, 3:57 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: exactly lmao
10/20/22, 3:57 PM - Ryan: Probably no

It's not that severe
10/20/22, 3:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: Don't fulfill the expectation if you feel it's useless
10/20/22, 3:57 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: education sustem
10/20/22, 3:57 PM - Ryan: But it is sad
10/20/22, 3:57 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yes
10/20/22, 3:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: Something is not sad, it's just what we choose to call it
10/20/22, 3:58 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/20/22, 3:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/20/22, 3:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: Both in the physical and metaphorical sense
10/20/22, 3:58 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/20/22, 3:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: Not getting 95% doesn't mean you have to get 65%
10/20/22, 3:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: Am I sure that I am sure?
10/20/22, 3:59 PM - Ryan: Hmm does that make sense

I can't comprehend it
10/20/22, 3:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: I claim to be sure
Do I claim to be sure about my claim?

I don't know man. Probably? So I am not sure if I am sure. Am I even sure then? I don't think it matters
10/20/22, 4:00 PM - Ryan: I don't know

Does it?
10/20/22, 4:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: What matters is what helps you make more useful decisions. We could define useful and spend time on that but IMO it doesn't give the best answer in the shortest amount of time, so see (I)

It is our choice to view bad marks as sad

That choice may be fairly useful sometimes. Other times not so much

In the case of school exams, maybe the choice isn't 100% useful.

What is a correct choice? Many ways to implore this question, but when considering education, I'll say getting the most knowledge morally matters (I)

Generally, getting lower marks means less knowledge, but IMO there's a blurry line somewhere - Not full marks, but enough that you've learnt useful things from it. And this line falls somewhere other than the line of expectation, usually. Our parents, teachers, etc usually expect the best marks possible instead of the most knowledge

Do you think you have free will?
10/20/22, 4:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: <Media omitted>
10/20/22, 4:06 PM - Ryan: Are bad marks really sad?

You will forget about them, and if you don't have any interest than teachers probably can't do anything

But what if you are constantly reminded of your marks, constantly taunted and pointed-out for your failures

Wouldn't that be sad
10/20/22, 4:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: It will be sad for you
10/20/22, 4:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: If you choose to view them as bad
10/20/22, 4:06 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: some people decide their self esteem based upon their marks
10/20/22, 4:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: Sad ‚â† Bad necessarily?
10/20/22, 4:06 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/20/22, 4:08 PM - Ryan: But I think it is saddening for the student which couldn't get the marks

What can he do if he doesn't like the subject?

He is just forced to study it even though it would teach him nothing except memorizing

Isn't it useless then
10/20/22, 4:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yeah
10/20/22, 4:08 PM - Ryan: Probably
10/20/22, 4:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: It's useless in that case
10/20/22, 4:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: He can change if he likes the subject or not
10/20/22, 4:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: But there are many reasons for not liking it
10/20/22, 4:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: Which may make the change more difficult in some cases
10/20/22, 4:09 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?
10/20/22, 4:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: I think they can, yes
10/20/22, 4:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: But it will be hard
10/20/22, 4:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: People don't like doing hard thinfs
10/20/22, 4:09 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/20/22, 4:09 PM - Ryan: Atleast most people I think
10/20/22, 4:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: They'd rather be happy with bad marks than change something which does not need to be changed
10/20/22, 4:09 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/20/22, 4:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: Or maybe even something which does need to be changed
10/20/22, 4:11 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>

Is it true? Is it am accurate description?

I could be wrong with some things

Correct me if there is any mistake
10/20/22, 6:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: It is not accurate
10/20/22, 6:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: It was an older description
10/20/22, 6:21 PM - Ryan: Then why is it still used?
10/20/22, 6:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: The definition of acids and bases in the book is also the Arhennius definition iirc, not the modern one

10/20/22, 6:55 PM - Amritansh: Okbut did anyone ask...
10/20/22, 7:00 PM - Amritansh: @919454835401 is aditya vardahn right?
10/20/22, 7:01 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 what is N-acetyl glucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid and what role do they play in peptidoglycan

What is L-lysine, D-Analine,L-analine and L-glutamine?

What holds the peptidoglycan polymer together?

What is teichoic acid and lipoteichoic acid? what is their role?

What are integral membrane proteins?
10/20/22, 7:01 PM - Amritansh: @919717944490
10/20/22, 7:02 PM - Ryan: What do you mean?

What is the context?
10/20/22, 7:02 PM - Amritansh: Nro
10/20/22, 7:02 PM - Amritansh: <Media omitted>
10/20/22, 7:02 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/20/22, 7:02 PM - Amritansh: Okay
10/20/22, 7:12 PM - Anant Tiwari: nacetylglucosamine and nacetylmuramic form the sugar component of the wall, and the muramic acid more peptide chains, so the points for cross-link arrangement

"what holds it together" the bond structures is cross-linked, nice and stable so that holds it together so that holds it right..? i mean is there anything extra to add on

i don't know the other compounds and acids you mentioned

the integral membrane proteins are proteins inside the various membranes.. they just do same function as msot other proteins. is it supposed to do something special? it's just proteins in membranes
10/20/22, 7:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: Master i shall do research and provide you the rest of the answers.
10/20/22, 7:16 PM - Ryan: üëç
10/20/22, 7:18 PM - Ryan: Can we completely prevent change  @917838968821

Change in behaviour, personality, mental-state, surroundings etc

Can we stop change as atleast in human nature?
10/20/22, 7:19 PM - Ryan: Anant very smart
10/20/22, 7:21 PM - Amritansh: Anant sehr klug
10/20/22, 7:21 PM - Ryan: German?
10/20/22, 7:21 PM - Amritansh: Ja
10/20/22, 7:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: Hmmmm
10/20/22, 7:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: ü§î
10/20/22, 7:27 PM - Aditya Vardhan: we  were going to  have gun
10/20/22, 7:27 PM - Aditya Vardhan: and explore places
10/20/22, 7:28 PM - Aditya Vardhan: ryan: explode what places?
10/20/22, 7:28 PM - Aditya Vardhan: dc:statue of immunity
10/20/22, 7:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: Honestly this is a very interesting question

Because usually in this topic people are talking about how to change, how to improve
10/20/22, 7:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: How to stagnate?
10/20/22, 7:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: I'll think and write later
10/20/22, 7:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: Brain cpu 100%
10/20/22, 7:36 PM - Ryan: <Media omitted>
10/20/22, 7:36 PM - Ryan: How could we solve that way
10/20/22, 7:37 PM - Dev: x+5+3x+5=66
10/20/22, 7:37 PM - Dev: His age is x
10/20/22, 7:37 PM - Dev: After five years it will be x+5
10/20/22, 7:37 PM - Dev: His mother's age is 3x
10/20/22, 7:38 PM - Dev: After 5 year it will be 3x+5
10/20/22, 7:38 PM - Ryan: Yes but then Sahil's mother's age wouldn't be 3x if I take Sahil's age 5 years later to be x I think
10/20/22, 7:38 PM - Dev: And it will add up to 66
10/20/22, 7:38 PM - Ryan: I tried this way and got the answer
10/20/22, 7:38 PM - Ryan: 14 and 42 right?
10/20/22, 7:38 PM - Dev: His present age is x
10/20/22, 7:38 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/20/22, 7:39 PM - Dev: This message was deleted
10/20/22, 7:39 PM - Ryan: But in the other green box, it is suggesting another way

I don't know how to go by that method
10/20/22, 7:39 PM - Dev: I think , it is just explained it. We have to do it by solving it
10/20/22, 7:40 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/20/22, 7:40 PM - Dev: Yes
10/20/22, 7:41 PM - Ryan: <Media omitted>
10/20/22, 7:41 PM - Ryan: I can't understand
10/20/22, 7:43 PM - Dev: I don't understand
10/20/22, 7:43 PM - Dev: May be another way of doing
10/20/22, 7:43 PM - Ryan: I also can't understand
10/20/22, 7:43 PM - Navya: hlo
10/20/22, 7:44 PM - Dev: Can someone send the question answers of ssc
10/20/22, 7:44 PM - Dev: Ma'am made us mark
10/20/22, 7:52 PM - Ryan: I need to confirm one thing about the points for the answer of Rowlatt act?

1. The Rowlatt Act was an act which allowed the British government to imprison people without due trial

2. Indian nationalists including Mahatma Gandhi were vehement in their opposition to the Rowlatt bills.

3. Despite the large number of protests, the Rowlatt Act came into effect on 10 March 1919. In Punjab, protests against this Act continued quite actively and on April 10, two leaders of the movement, Dr Satyapal and Dr Saifuddin Kitchlew were arrested.

4. To protest these arrests, a public meeting was held on 13 April at Jallianwalah Bagh in Amritsar. General Dyer entered the park with his troops. They closed the only exit and without giving any warning General Dyer ordered the troops to fire.

5. Several hundreds of people died in this gunfire and many more were wounded including women and children
10/20/22, 7:53 PM - Ryan: Are these points correct?
10/20/22, 7:53 PM - Ryan: I am not confident about SSC
10/20/22, 7:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: as a continuation of the origin equation, you can let x + 5 = y and then do the same steps with y - 5
10/20/22, 7:55 PM - Amritansh: I am sad anant that you won't come :(
10/20/22, 7:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
10/20/22, 7:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yea :(
10/20/22, 7:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: I haven't even written myself lol but yes they are good points
10/20/22, 7:58 PM - Ryan: There are 5 more questions left to be marked in SSC right?
10/20/22, 7:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: absent tha
10/20/22, 7:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: i don't know kitne more
10/20/22, 7:59 PM - Amritansh: Yo ryan

10/20/22, 8:10 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: it is you
10/20/22, 8:10 PM - Amritansh 2: Neelambuj same

10/20/22, 8:11 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: so that means
10/20/22, 8:11 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ryan is the topped
10/20/22, 8:11 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: amazing
10/20/22, 8:11 PM - Amritansh 2: Yes
10/20/22, 8:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: Probably
10/20/22, 8:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: uhhhhh didn't like 8g ke exams mey
10/20/22, 8:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: well
10/20/22, 8:12 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: que what happen
10/20/22, 8:12 PM - Ryan: Well it doesn't matter

It is useless and maybe worthless

Everyone will forget in a day or so
10/20/22, 8:12 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: true
10/20/22, 8:12 PM - Ryan: Even the parents don't care that much
10/20/22, 8:12 PM - Anant Tiwari: im not putting any names but if i heard correctly waha people 2 seats behind se cheat
10/20/22, 8:12 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/20/22, 8:13 PM - Ryan: All that effort worthless?
10/20/22, 8:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
10/20/22, 8:13 PM - Ryan: I didn't learn anything
10/20/22, 8:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: Then yes
10/20/22, 8:14 PM - Ryan: Such a waste
10/20/22, 8:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: I think you probably learnt many things
10/20/22, 8:14 PM - Ryan: I am truly useless
10/20/22, 8:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't think it was a waste
10/20/22, 8:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: Are you sure
10/20/22, 8:15 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: no buddy
10/20/22, 8:15 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: itni acchi art aati hai
10/20/22, 8:15 PM - Ryan: No

I think if somebody has proper functioning limbs and a healthy body then labour
10/20/22, 8:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: So a person is useless if they can't work in a factory?
10/20/22, 8:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: i'd like to disagree
10/20/22, 8:15 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: same
10/20/22, 8:15 PM - Ryan: And not only that, I think the dumbest of persons can be used in some way
10/20/22, 8:16 PM - Ryan: Experiments
10/20/22, 8:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: And you can work in a factory, probably make the factory
10/20/22, 8:16 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: true true
10/20/22, 8:16 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ah yes
10/20/22, 8:16 PM - Ryan: No

If they don't have a proper functioning body then they could use their mind
10/20/22, 8:16 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: telekenesis se factory? interesting
10/20/22, 8:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: Or can use both which you have
10/20/22, 8:20 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/20/22, 8:20 PM - Ryan: I don't
10/20/22, 8:20 PM - Ryan: I am getting weaker and stupider
10/20/22, 8:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: Are you sure
10/20/22, 8:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: You can change that
10/20/22, 8:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: Or can you?
10/20/22, 8:20 PM - Ryan: I can't
10/20/22, 8:21 PM - Ryan: I am worsening
10/20/22, 8:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: Are you sure
10/20/22, 8:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: Can't is a strong word
10/20/22, 8:21 PM - Ryan: I will perform severely bad in Term-2 I think
10/20/22, 8:21 PM - Ryan: Yes it is
10/20/22, 8:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ill quote this message at the end of 8th
10/20/22, 8:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: Infact
10/20/22, 8:21 PM - Ryan: But I am not
10/20/22, 8:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: are you sure
10/20/22, 8:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: Are you sure
10/20/22, 8:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't think you failed in either of those
10/20/22, 8:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: You won't fail
10/20/22, 8:22 PM - Ryan: I would probably
10/20/22, 8:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: https://www.coursera.org/browse/data-science/probability-and-statistics
10/20/22, 8:24 PM - Ryan: Oh no

I am too stupid for that
10/20/22, 8:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: nahiiii
10/20/22, 8:24 PM - Ryan: But seriously

I am getting worse
10/20/22, 8:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
10/20/22, 8:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: okay it happens
10/20/22, 8:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: why can't you change it then
10/20/22, 8:24 PM - Ryan: Because I am a human
10/20/22, 8:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: do you not have free will
are you succumbing to nihilistic pleasure
10/20/22, 8:24 PM - Ryan: And humans have limits
10/20/22, 8:24 PM - Ryan: Humans are weak and pathetic
10/20/22, 8:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: so other humans have free willl but you dont?
10/20/22, 8:24 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: youre getting worse? from what
10/20/22, 8:25 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: -1% from your report card
10/20/22, 8:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: .71%*
10/20/22, 8:25 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: are you monke
10/20/22, 8:25 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: nerd
10/20/22, 8:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: Not even 1%
10/20/22, 8:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: chup raho
10/20/22, 8:26 PM - Ryan: Humans like any other animal have emotions

Emotions are cringe

They are distracting, make you stupid, weaker, more pathetic
10/20/22, 8:27 PM - Ryan: Waste of time and thought
10/20/22, 8:27 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: good idea
10/20/22, 8:27 PM - Ryan: Many students are already continuously wasting their time
10/20/22, 8:27 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: very true
10/20/22, 8:27 PM - Ryan: Like me
10/20/22, 8:27 PM - Ryan: Right now
10/20/22, 8:27 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ryan can you give me tips on being emotionless
10/20/22, 8:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes emotions are useless if you want to be a robot to achieve 100% efficiency
10/20/22, 8:27 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ok then put your phone away
10/20/22, 8:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
10/20/22, 8:27 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: üòÇ
10/20/22, 8:28 PM - Ryan: You can't

The healthy brain won't allow you to be emotionless
10/20/22, 8:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/20/22, 8:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: That is true
10/20/22, 8:28 PM - Ryan: Robots are superior
10/20/22, 8:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: An emotionless perfect person will take generations of conditioning
10/20/22, 8:28 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: can ashwagandha make you emotionless
10/20/22, 8:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: Or drugs
10/20/22, 8:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: Both work
10/20/22, 8:28 PM - Ryan: But we don't have generations
10/20/22, 8:28 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ah yes gen z
10/20/22, 8:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: im going to hit you with a pure-vanadium rod
10/20/22, 8:29 PM - Ryan: Vanadium
10/20/22, 8:29 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: bonk
10/20/22, 8:30 PM - Ryan: Seriously

What emotions have led you to @919999373163 @917838968821


Emotions made you seek pleasure? Made you distracted from studying?

Do you find emotion beneficial
10/20/22, 8:30 PM - Ryan: They only cloud your judgement
10/20/22, 8:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: Emotions lead to pleasure
10/20/22, 8:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: i probably can't change them due to eons of biochemistrial conditioning
10/20/22, 8:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: And also to pain
10/20/22, 8:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: They're not amazing
10/20/22, 8:31 PM - Ryan: Emotions negatively impact thought
10/20/22, 8:31 PM - Ryan: Emotions?
10/20/22, 8:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: But I can't easily change them

I can control their effects though
10/20/22, 8:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: Pain is a feeling
10/20/22, 8:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: Closely linked concepts, I won't go into semantics
10/20/22, 8:32 PM - Ryan: Is pain an emotion
10/20/22, 8:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't know, probably?
10/20/22, 8:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: the point of the discussion is if theyre useful. knowing what they are is not necessary, it may not lead us to finding the answer
10/20/22, 8:32 PM - Ryan: Pain is caused by our nerves right?

Emotions are caused by hormones?
10/20/22, 8:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: Let's approximate pain, emotions, hormones, nerve signals etc to "biochemistry"
10/20/22, 8:33 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ah yes emotions, i don't like them but most of the time i cant handle them

if im feeling sad, ill be sad
if im feeling happy, ill be happy
if i feel like crying, ill cry
10/20/22, 8:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: Biochemistry is annoying
10/20/22, 8:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: bri
10/20/22, 8:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: to handle an emotion it doesn't mean dont do that emotion
10/20/22, 8:33 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: pain goes by when you dont think about it]
10/20/22, 8:33 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i dont want to handle them
10/20/22, 8:33 PM - Ryan: Pain is useful as well as useless

Pain helps you survive
The fear of Pain

Pains helps you learn

But Pain weakens you
10/20/22, 8:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: it means don't let it affect something too much
10/20/22, 8:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: that's fine
10/20/22, 8:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: to some extent
10/20/22, 8:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: everyone cries
10/20/22, 8:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: you can barely change this
10/20/22, 8:34 PM - Ryan: Would you want soldiers who experience pain or soldiers who don't
10/20/22, 8:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: without a LOT of effort
10/20/22, 8:34 PM - Dev: @919999373163 dm dhek
10/20/22, 8:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: Both are fine
10/20/22, 8:34 PM - Ryan: Pain is necessary
10/20/22, 8:34 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: aa
10/20/22, 8:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: Pain is pretty good in those situations
10/20/22, 8:34 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/20/22, 8:34 PM - Ryan: But are you sure
10/20/22, 8:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: I mean soldiers are a good example of those people who can control the _effects_ of their emotions given enough conditioning
10/20/22, 8:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: Knowing you can die
10/20/22, 8:34 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/20/22, 8:35 PM - Ryan: Emotions bad
10/20/22, 8:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: To benefit society, which you won't be able to experience
10/20/22, 8:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: Can be controlled though
10/20/22, 8:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: To some extent
10/20/22, 8:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: Soldiers feel pain too, emotions too
10/20/22, 8:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: They still cope for no personal benefit
10/20/22, 8:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: Can you be a soldier?
10/20/22, 8:35 PM - Ryan: Ni
10/20/22, 8:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: üëç
10/20/22, 8:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: I think both of us are already failing in the "being a soldier" thing
10/20/22, 8:36 PM - Ryan: Being a good soldier requires some patriotism, sense of duty, responsibility, and selfless-ness

I lack all
10/20/22, 8:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: Not spending our time properly
10/20/22, 8:36 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/20/22, 8:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: I mean
10/20/22, 8:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: Empathy is not something you get from birth
10/20/22, 8:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: Or sense of duty
10/20/22, 8:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: Or responsibility
10/20/22, 8:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: or selfless-ness
10/20/22, 8:37 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/20/22, 8:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: There's not much you can check in a baby's brain to figure out if they'll be a soldier

Probably not even most teenagers

Biochemistry does not completely override attempts to override biochemistry
10/20/22, 8:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: It's a painful process
10/20/22, 8:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: Not completely is not to be not at all
10/20/22, 8:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: And humans don't like pain, they like pleasure
10/20/22, 8:38 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/20/22, 8:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: Usually
10/20/22, 8:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: it's the case
10/20/22, 8:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: Sometimes pleasurable processes can help avoid pain
10/20/22, 8:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: Is exercise pleasurable?
10/20/22, 8:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: Is the satisfaction from working hard existent?
10/20/22, 8:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: In some cases yes
10/20/22, 8:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: Maybe we can study these cases on how to condition ourselves to do it
10/20/22, 8:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: Soldiers don't train themselves either too. It requires a training system
10/20/22, 8:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: Many people work to make one soldier
10/20/22, 8:41 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/20/22, 8:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: The equipment, the economy to support them
10/20/22, 8:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: I mean
10/20/22, 8:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: Most cases
10/20/22, 8:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/20/22, 8:41 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/20/22, 8:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: Even terrorist group members get a decent bit of training, don't they? The mental conditioning for blood from a young age, usually
10/20/22, 8:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: Giants rest on the shoulders of other giants, which are made of commoners
10/20/22, 8:43 PM - Ryan: I think the training of a soldier begins early

And they train themselves at first

And they get selected into the army after a test (I think), if they have trained themselves then they get selected (I think)
10/20/22, 8:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/20/22, 8:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: Begins on their own work
10/20/22, 8:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: Maybe you can simulate those conditions from more common people

Just like training requires a huge support system
That early training requires some form of support system as well

For some people the support system is their parents, for some it is living in bad conditions, wanting to break the vicious cycle of dying poor and making more poor people
10/20/22, 8:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: For the children growing in terrorist groups, it's that goal which they have been indoctrinated with

For people clearing a difficult exam, it's a decent environment to study, a decent school, supportive friends, parents

Those last support points apply to many other people
10/20/22, 8:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: I think most people can theoretically do it
10/20/22, 8:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: They can sometimes move it move it ü¶ß
10/20/22, 8:47 PM - Ryan: Supportive friends?
10/20/22, 8:47 PM - Ryan: What if no friends?
10/20/22, 8:47 PM - Ryan: A decent school?
10/20/22, 8:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: You deleted this message
10/20/22, 8:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
10/20/22, 8:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: they also play a role
10/20/22, 8:47 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: may happen next year with me
10/20/22, 8:48 PM - Ryan: I have been trained for exams, not for learning

I am the worse kind of student probably
10/20/22, 8:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: congratulations for escaping prison

to get into another one
10/20/22, 8:48 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: us
10/20/22, 8:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: I mean do you not remember a single thing from what you've learnt in the exams?
10/20/22, 8:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: (x * 5/3) + 32 = 16

You can find x now, that's cool innit
10/20/22, 8:49 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: wo to iss session mein yaad rehte hai
10/20/22, 8:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: You know how to calculate pressure
10/20/22, 8:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes but 11th ki book also requires algebra
10/20/22, 8:50 PM - Aditya Vardhan: This message was deleted
10/20/22, 8:50 PM - Aditya Vardhan: no
10/20/22, 8:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: there are two completely algebra related chapters in our book

4 in 9th
10/20/22, 8:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: the information is used later too, and you probably will remember it too
10/20/22, 8:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: you may not remember the exact ratta waala keypoints but
10/20/22, 8:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: something useful has been done
10/20/22, 8:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: maybe not in the most efficient way but kuch t≈ç hua
10/20/22, 8:51 PM - Aditya Vardhan: corelatibe force
10/20/22, 8:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: centripetal?
10/20/22, 8:51 PM - Aditya Vardhan: i will
10/20/22, 8:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: So @919717944490
10/20/22, 8:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: I think you probably can do it
10/20/22, 8:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: You have a higher chance than all of us
10/20/22, 8:51 PM - Aditya Vardhan: every __ meters 1 deggere decreases
10/20/22, 8:51 PM - Aditya Vardhan: straight up
10/20/22, 8:52 PM - Ryan: No
10/20/22, 8:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: Reasons?
10/20/22, 8:52 PM - Ryan: I am stupid
10/20/22, 8:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: according to you you've been trained to do exams
which i explained also helps in knowledge too probably
10/20/22, 8:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: and i assume knowledge is useful
10/20/22, 8:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: for becoming "the soldier"
10/20/22, 8:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: bhak
10/20/22, 8:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: change is hard and takes time üëç
10/20/22, 8:55 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/20/22, 8:56 PM - Ryan: And I am changing for worse
10/20/22, 8:56 PM - Ryan: Being like normal students is worse
10/20/22, 8:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/20/22, 8:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: Most people are useles
10/20/22, 8:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: s
10/20/22, 8:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: Including me
10/20/22, 8:57 PM - Ryan: Students are not supposed to be happy

They should only study
10/20/22, 8:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
10/20/22, 8:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: Lol
10/20/22, 8:57 PM - Ryan: Spend everytime for the better
10/20/22, 8:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: School gives scholar badge for arts for a reason

10/20/22, 8:58 PM - Amritansh: Your choice

Viewed as machines?

10/20/22, 9:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: It's valued somewhat
10/20/22, 9:00 PM - Ryan: Study for the solutions for peace
10/20/22, 9:00 PM - Ryan: Fun is useless
10/20/22, 9:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: Won't help you write a book
10/20/22, 9:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: We already know them
10/20/22, 9:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: Most people know the rough blueprint
10/20/22, 9:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: It's a complicated problem
10/20/22, 9:00 PM - Ryan: What most students are doing write now is waste
10/20/22, 9:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: Can be chipped down only
10/20/22, 9:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: small changes are easy but you're not attempting to do them at this moment
10/20/22, 9:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: Are you wasting your time too
10/20/22, 9:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: You can choose to improve in whatever way possible
10/20/22, 9:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: Something everyday. Something everyweek.
10/20/22, 9:02 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/20/22, 9:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: Maybe walk around while typing
10/20/22, 9:02 PM - Ryan: But will it be useful
10/20/22, 9:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: Some improvement
10/20/22, 9:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/20/22, 9:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: Sitting down on a chair is abd
10/20/22, 9:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: Usually
10/20/22, 9:03 PM - Ryan: Ok
10/20/22, 9:26 PM - Ryan: Are we supposed to bring scissors too for the lantern making?

But Scissors are not allowed according to the Almanac
10/20/22, 9:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: Cut with teeth
10/20/22, 9:27 PM - Ryan: Not accurate enough

Saliva

Waste of paper
10/20/22, 9:28 PM - Ryan: And also, fighting the desire to eat the paper
10/20/22, 9:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: Eat it
10/20/22, 9:49 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: eat it lmao
10/20/22, 9:49 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: it'll dissolve with your saliva

10/20/22, 9:54 PM - Aditya Vardhan: a boss can break his own rules

10/21/22, 8:37 PM - Aditya Vardhan: money grow on tree
10/21/22, 8:37 PM - Aditya Vardhan: no
10/21/22, 8:37 PM - Aditya Vardhan: it gives luck as believed
10/21/22, 8:37 PM - Ryan: But money plant  no tree
10/21/22, 8:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: or does it
10/21/22, 8:37 PM - Aditya Vardhan: and luck gives you money
10/21/22, 8:38 PM - Aditya Vardhan: so money plant
10/21/22, 8:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: because money grows on trees
10/21/22, 8:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: on plants

10/21/22, 8:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ok
10/21/22, 8:50 PM - Ryan: He says 93% is bad

10/21/22, 8:50 PM - Ryan: 99% is bad
10/21/22, 8:51 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: are you okay bro
10/21/22, 8:51 PM - Ryan: Imagine losing 1 percent
10/21/22, 8:51 PM - Ryan: I am the stupidest in the class
10/21/22, 8:51 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ok buddy
10/21/22, 8:52 PM - Ryan: I am also probably changing in a bad way
10/21/22, 8:53 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: what do you mean by changing
10/21/22, 8:53 PM - Ryan: Started wasting my time
10/21/22, 8:53 PM - Ryan: Starting to get distracted
10/21/22, 8:53 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: how much do you think an 8th grader has to actually study
10/21/22, 8:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: <Media omitted>
10/21/22, 8:54 PM - Ryan: And I think suppressing emotions is also a very important

And I am getting weaker in these terms
10/21/22, 8:54 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: LMAO
10/21/22, 8:54 PM - Ryan: Taking actions governed by sadness and anger is not good
10/21/22, 8:54 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: is this high level of sarcasm or are you actually
10/21/22, 8:54 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i dont know man
10/21/22, 8:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: he's entering a new plane of existence
10/21/22, 8:55 PM - Ryan: And students make you angry
10/21/22, 8:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: he's entering the 5th dimension while we weren't sure if the 4th spatial dimension even existed
10/21/22, 8:55 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ah yes
10/21/22, 8:55 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: life

10/21/22, 8:55 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: students in my bus room make me wanna punch them
10/21/22, 8:56 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: they have punchable faces
10/21/22, 8:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: Why suppress emotions when you can suppress effects of emotions instead
10/21/22, 8:56 PM - Navya: haryanvi pop and bhojpuri pop the best
10/21/22, 8:56 PM - Ryan: But you can't

You shouldn't

Or else there will be consequences
10/21/22, 8:56 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: how do you
10/21/22, 8:56 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: Of course there will be consequences
10/21/22, 8:56 PM - Ryan: And there are cases when you just don't stop punching

That is scary
10/21/22, 8:56 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: what will mam do?
10/21/22, 8:56 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: scold me? I'll forget it that same day
10/21/22, 8:56 PM - Ryan: Won't stop punching until it's too late
10/21/22, 8:56 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yes i've seen that in movies
10/21/22, 8:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: Guys lets debate
10/21/22, 8:56 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: too much fleshy
10/21/22, 8:56 PM - Ryan: I won't

I am weak
10/21/22, 8:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: Do you think murder is good
10/21/22, 8:57 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: depends
10/21/22, 8:57 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/21/22, 8:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: IMO Yes, i like when the blood comes out
10/21/22, 8:57 PM - Ryan: Execution of certain dangerous people is important
10/21/22, 8:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: Or is t
10/21/22, 8:57 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: weak as in what sense?
physically or mentally

i would have to disagree with you saying that you're physically weak
10/21/22, 8:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: Do you think kim jong un assassination would help
10/21/22, 8:57 PM - Ryan: No
10/21/22, 8:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: weak in self confidence?
10/21/22, 8:58 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: but i want to kill him
10/21/22, 8:58 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: isn't that mentally? but also physically
10/21/22, 8:58 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: connected
10/21/22, 8:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: true!
10/21/22, 8:58 PM - Ryan: But assassination of mentally-unstable criminals is necessary

Because it is dangerous to reintroduce them into society
10/21/22, 8:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: You deleted this message
10/21/22, 8:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: delete

more chances of criminals being born in the society

so i dont know man
10/21/22, 8:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: people oppose death penalty
10/21/22, 8:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: Death is not very painful I guess
10/21/22, 8:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: Less painful than prison
10/21/22, 8:59 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: This message was deleted
10/21/22, 8:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: Me too
10/21/22, 8:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: The sp?
10/21/22, 8:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: What
10/21/22, 8:59 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: tasty jelly
10/21/22, 8:59 PM - Ryan: Death probably isn't

The process of dying is I think
10/21/22, 8:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/21/22, 9:00 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: people say that you go through a flashback of lifetime moments when you die
10/21/22, 9:00 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: like a movie
10/21/22, 9:00 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: is that true or completely made up and spread
10/21/22, 9:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: the death is like a payback
10/21/22, 9:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: made up
10/21/22, 9:00 PM - Ryan: Probably completely made up
10/21/22, 9:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: ndes cause weird things tho
10/21/22, 9:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: wrong reply
10/21/22, 9:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: near death experience
10/21/22, 9:00 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yeah
10/21/22, 9:01 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: do you even die or do you just sleep and your soul teleports to somewhere
10/21/22, 9:01 PM - Ryan: Because I don't know how the brain would play a flashback while currently it is "Aaaa...Glu..uh....Aaaa"
10/21/22, 9:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: no one knows
10/21/22, 9:01 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: somewhere not on earth (unless)
10/21/22, 9:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: Is like to believe that
10/21/22, 9:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: HAHAHA
10/21/22, 9:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
10/21/22, 9:01 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: LMAO
10/21/22, 9:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: but probably you just dont experiences things
10/21/22, 9:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: damaged brain = less consciousness, understanding
10/21/22, 9:01 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: like after you're completely dead
10/21/22, 9:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: no brain = no
10/21/22, 9:02 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: true
10/21/22, 9:02 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: true true
10/21/22, 9:02 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: therefore completely made up anant if you type something on flashbacks after death ill spam you with nerd emojis
10/21/22, 9:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: analogy: I'm taking the limit of the consciousness function with respect to brain damage

i don't know what happens to consciousness when brain damage = 100, but judging by brain damage = 90, brain damage = 99 I can say that it'll probably increase
10/21/22, 9:03 PM - Navya: tumlog
10/21/22, 9:03 PM - Navya: bahut

10/21/22, 9:03 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: this was related to flashbacks after death
10/21/22, 9:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't care
10/21/22, 9:03 PM - Navya: bhak
10/21/22, 9:03 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: urge
10/21/22, 9:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: You won't have flashbacks
10/21/22, 9:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: Because you're mentally retarded

Why? Or why not?
10/21/22, 10:25 PM - Ryan: Is the new organism produced exactly like the parent organism?
10/21/22, 10:25 PM - Ryan: Can you become a hermaphrodite capable of producing clones?
10/21/22, 10:25 PM - Ryan: @917838968821
10/21/22, 10:27 PM - Ryan: How were we able to create a clone for Dolly

10/22/22, 10:56 AM - Anant Tiwari: I will not watch
10/22/22, 11:11 AM - Amritansh: Ryan.
10/22/22, 11:11 AM - Amritansh: I know what you did.
10/22/22, 11:11 AM - Amritansh: You broke the table...
10/22/22, 11:17 AM - Anant Tiwari: What
10/22/22, 11:17 AM - You changed the subject from "grp founder ka bday" to "Da brib üê¶"
10/22/22, 11:19 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: hmm what
10/22/22, 11:19 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: did he
10/22/22, 11:20 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: its my guitar sir, he covered a song
10/22/22, 11:20 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: pls listen
10/22/22, 11:25 AM - Ryan: What
10/22/22, 11:26 AM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/22/22, 11:29 AM - Ryan: And also

There are practical marks in science?
10/22/22, 11:29 AM - Ryan: @917838968821
10/22/22, 11:30 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: will there be practicals?
10/22/22, 11:30 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: for science and maybe for other subs too?
10/22/22, 11:30 AM - Ryan: I don't know
10/22/22, 11:30 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: but you just asked if there will be practical marks
10/22/22, 11:30 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: so im guessing yes?
10/22/22, 11:31 AM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/22/22, 11:31 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: practicals aise hi thodina hote hai
10/22/22, 11:31 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: why don't you ask mam then
10/22/22, 11:33 AM - Ryan: I am failing in practical if there is going to be any

I have the sight of a rhino and the hearing of a snail

And if I don't know the functioning of the model then I can't make it on my own
10/22/22, 11:33 AM - Anant Tiwari: 9th grade
10/22/22, 11:33 AM - Anant Tiwari: Not from now
10/22/22, 11:33 AM - Anant Tiwari: oh i shall
10/22/22, 11:34 AM - Anant Tiwari: None in 8th
10/22/22, 11:36 AM - Anant Tiwari: how can you say that you have bad sight and hearing

if you do, literally go to a doctor

but i don't think you do, atleast as far as i have seen

it's not constructive self-criticism at all imo

I've not seen you have issues with seeing or hearing

and if you do, you must fix them
10/22/22, 11:36 AM - Ryan: Hearing definitely
10/22/22, 11:37 AM - Anant Tiwari: okay fair
10/22/22, 11:37 AM - Anant Tiwari: i don't know your perspective
10/22/22, 11:37 AM - Anant Tiwari: and its unfortunate if you have hearing issues
10/22/22, 11:37 AM - Ryan: And my ears are completely fine according to the doctor
10/22/22, 11:37 AM - Ryan: I don't know what is the problem
10/22/22, 11:38 AM - Anant Tiwari: try to quantify it

are sounds too hard to distinguish? or too feeble? or do your ears hurt? can they not hear beyond a certain range?
10/22/22, 11:38 AM - Ryan: Identifying sounds
10/22/22, 11:39 AM - Anant Tiwari: damn welp
10/22/22, 11:39 AM - Anant Tiwari: that's kinda unfortunate esp if doctor dont know
10/22/22, 11:39 AM - Ryan: Maybe I am not focused enough
10/22/22, 11:40 AM - Anant Tiwari: i dont realise sometimes when someone is talking to me either, maybe part of it is because people speak randomly

i mean if you're in a conversation then maybe it's easier to hear

also classroom too loud and annoying
10/22/22, 11:40 AM - Ryan: According to him, I am ignoring them a little bit
10/22/22, 11:40 AM - Anant Tiwari: him who
10/22/22, 11:40 AM - Ryan: Doctor
10/22/22, 11:41 AM - Anant Tiwari: what about eye issue
10/22/22, 11:41 AM - Anant Tiwari: did doctor have anything to say on it
10/22/22, 11:41 AM - Ryan: Eyes seem fine
10/22/22, 11:41 AM - Anant Tiwari: good
10/22/22, 12:43 PM - Amritansh: Yes
10/22/22, 1:14 PM - Amritansh 2: Hi
10/22/22, 1:16 PM - Ryan: I was literally staring at the birds the whole time

And are you talking about the dining table
10/22/22, 1:16 PM - Amritansh: Lol
10/22/22, 1:16 PM - Amritansh: I know
10/22/22, 1:16 PM - Amritansh: I was just asking
10/22/22, 1:16 PM - Amritansh: Because my table is now broken
10/22/22, 1:16 PM - Ryan: Which table
10/22/22, 1:17 PM - Amritansh: <Media omitted>
10/22/22, 1:17 PM - Ryan: What is this?
10/22/22, 1:17 PM - Ryan: And this table is set up vertically?
10/22/22, 1:22 PM - Navya: white board
10/22/22, 1:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: So how did Ryan break your table???
10/22/22, 1:39 PM - Amritansh: It broke somehow
10/22/22, 1:39 PM - Amritansh: And Ryan asked me at the end if there was CCTV camera in my house
10/22/22, 1:39 PM - Amritansh: Also anant please send tinetamble of you
10/22/22, 1:39 PM - Amritansh: Like your daily routine
10/22/22, 1:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: he likes to joke about things like that
10/22/22, 1:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: im pretty sure ryan didn't do any trolly
10/22/22, 1:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: accha
10/22/22, 1:41 PM - Amritansh: Ye
10/22/22, 1:41 PM - Amritansh: Send
10/22/22, 1:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: dm
10/22/22, 8:05 PM - Amritansh: Dining table?
10/22/22, 8:05 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: Dining table?
10/22/22, 8:11 PM - Ryan: Hmm

Ok
10/22/22, 8:26 PM - Amritansh: Hmm

Ok
10/22/22, 9:01 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 Can stupid people get high marks?
10/22/22, 9:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes

10/22/22, 10:01 PM - Amritansh 2: Yes?
10/22/22, 10:17 PM - Ryan: How
10/22/22, 10:18 PM - Ryan: Aren't stupid people not supposed to get high marks

Aren't exams made to differ the intelligent from the stupid?

Or the lazy from the hard-working?
10/22/22, 10:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: Because the definition of stupid is vague
10/22/22, 10:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't understand the point of this question
10/22/22, 10:26 PM - Ryan: Confusing truly
10/22/22, 10:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: Why does it matter
10/22/22, 10:27 PM - Ryan: Can exams help identify intellect?
10/22/22, 10:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
10/22/22, 10:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: They are useless
10/22/22, 10:27 PM - Ryan: Then why are exams conducted
10/22/22, 10:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: They have never been seriously used to identify intellect
10/22/22, 10:27 PM - Ryan: Why are we judged because of exams
10/22/22, 10:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: To tell you that you are lazy
10/22/22, 10:28 PM - Ryan: Yes probably
10/22/22, 10:30 PM - Ryan: Why can't lazy people be hard-working easily?

What makes hard-working people work hard? Why work hard?
10/22/22, 10:30 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: school
10/22/22, 10:30 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: many people are judged
10/22/22, 10:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: Man I'm tired of this topic of discussion
10/22/22, 10:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: I get it. The education system is shitty. Exams are useless
10/22/22, 10:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: Why do we have to keep discussing about it
10/22/22, 10:31 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/22/22, 10:31 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: exactly lmao
10/22/22, 10:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: I'm trying to cope with it and I don't see what changes I can bring about it
10/22/22, 10:31 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i think its the 4th time
10/22/22, 10:31 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: you can't, many students have probably tried to change the edu system
10/22/22, 10:31 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: but failed because retabr
10/22/22, 10:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: Marks... exams... grades... I honestly don't care.
10/22/22, 10:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: I just want to do fun things
10/22/22, 10:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: And I already do
10/22/22, 10:32 PM - Ryan: We don't probably

I think we already are equipped with our judgements and opinions

And the discussion isn't in the opposite to the opinion as of now

Is there any point of discussion
10/22/22, 10:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: So i don't feel like discussing it
10/22/22, 10:32 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/22/22, 10:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: Now I shall cut vegetables, bye
10/22/22, 10:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes because I claim to not care
10/22/22, 10:32 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: minecraft all day imagine
10/22/22, 10:32 PM - Ryan: Claims do not hold much importance
10/22/22, 10:33 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: hmm
10/22/22, 10:33 PM - Ryan: People change and hypocrisy emerges out as we learn new things which amend our previous opinions
10/22/22, 10:33 PM - Ryan: (I don't know what I am talking about)
10/22/22, 10:34 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: lmao bhai mein bhi confuse hogaya
10/22/22, 10:36 PM - Ryan: If you are acting of being something for a long time

Will it eventually affect you?
10/22/22, 10:36 PM - Ryan: Or being someone?
10/22/22, 10:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: maybe
10/22/22, 10:38 PM - Ryan: And also


What is being biased?
10/22/22, 10:38 PM - Ryan: @917838968821
10/22/22, 10:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: if they prefer one group of people
10/22/22, 10:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: than th eother
10/22/22, 10:40 PM - Ryan: Hmm

Discrimination?
10/22/22, 10:41 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: No
10/22/22, 10:41 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/22/22, 10:42 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rSBS3W646I

10/22/22, 11:34 PM - Dev: Like a frog but with a tail double its size
10/22/22, 11:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: what is such paradoxical about it's nature which resulted in said name of the specie?
10/22/22, 11:37 PM - Dev: I donno

10/23/22, 12:50 AM - Navya: hhh
10/23/22, 8:35 AM - Ryan: @917838968821 does practical need theory?

Practical and theory

They are both important right? And interrelated?
10/23/22, 8:43 AM - Anant Tiwari: yed
10/23/22, 8:43 AM - Anant Tiwari: 10 marks practical next year, from 10th i think 20

10/23/22, 11:40 AM - Anant Tiwari: tbh i think they'll catch issues most of the time in the two normal checking so on average you'll probably get higher

10/23/22, 12:24 PM - Ryan: Just asking
10/23/22, 12:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: law is when that idea is actually enforced
10/23/22, 12:24 PM - Ryan: Yes

10/23/22, 12:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: bill you make edits usually before it gets passed, since it's not set in ground

to modify law you have to make ammendment
10/23/22, 12:24 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: "yes darash batra"
10/23/22, 12:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: haha
10/23/22, 12:25 PM - Ryan: But can you define a bill in like 4 lines

10/23/22, 12:25 PM - Ryan: Yes regarding the law
10/23/22, 12:25 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: amazing

10/23/22, 12:26 PM - Ryan: I am going to fail in SSC
10/23/22, 12:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: Constructive self-criticism, please
10/23/22, 12:26 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: funny
10/23/22, 12:27 PM - Ryan: Now one more question

Is a law required to be accepted by people?

Not talking about democracy here
10/23/22, 12:27 PM - Ryan: What is the difference between rule of law and rule by law
10/23/22, 12:28 PM - Ryan: What is the meaning of sedition?
10/23/22, 12:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: People will get angry at you if the law is shitty
10/23/22, 12:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: More unrest
10/23/22, 12:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: Less happy people
10/23/22, 12:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: Generally you would want to avoid it even in a flawed democracy
10/23/22, 12:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: In dictatorships, eh, doesn't matter much
10/23/22, 12:28 PM - Ryan: What is the difference between a controversial law and unpopular law
10/23/22, 12:28 PM - Ryan: @919999373163
10/23/22, 12:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: As long as the people who are responsible for enforcing it are willing to enforce it, it's going to work
10/23/22, 12:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't know
10/23/22, 12:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: rule of law: laws are supreme
10/23/22, 12:29 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: jfshjsfhfsjhfshs questions from the chapter
10/23/22, 12:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: rule by law: things must be defined by law before decision
10/23/22, 12:29 PM - Ryan: Yea
10/23/22, 12:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: a country following rule of law also follows rule by law but one which follows rule by law may not necessarily follow rule of law
10/23/22, 12:30 PM - Ryan: I want full marks from you in SSC

@919999373163
10/23/22, 12:30 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: is this a threat lmamo
10/23/22, 12:30 PM - Ryan: Are you willing to get them?
10/23/22, 12:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: I think in the specific case of British India, it was when govmint could enforce unreasonable laws without trials

otherwise I think it means separation
10/23/22, 12:30 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: oh yes
10/23/22, 12:31 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/23/22, 12:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: Kinda similar

Things may be popular but a small minority may hate it _a lot_, that is a controversial, popular law
10/23/22, 12:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
10/23/22, 12:31 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: master i shall not let you down

10/24/22, 1:49 PM - Aditya Vardhan: somethings are named after the first company that started mass producing the product
10/24/22, 1:49 PM - Aditya Vardhan: eg Rubik's cube
10/24/22, 1:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: rubik was the surname of the guy
10/24/22, 2:17 PM - Ryan: Heart issue?

Due to stress from the constant noise of the firecrackers and high blood pressure?
10/24/22, 2:27 PM - Ryan: And is pollution going to be worse than last year?

Does the climate and temperature play a role in the effect of pollution on us?

Will there still be smog out there?
10/24/22, 2:38 PM - Dev: <Media omitted>

10/24/22, 2:58 PM - Tanmaya: Ok
10/24/22, 3:06 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 are you sure for question "who introduced the Rule of Law in India?" We should just write "it was the British Colonialists who introduced the Rule of Law in India"

Is this answer enough? Shouldn't it be any longer? Am I missing something?
10/24/22, 3:06 PM - Dev: <Media omitted>
10/24/22, 3:13 PM - Dev: Anyone play fall guys?
10/24/22, 3:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: Banning

10/24/22, 3:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: I think it's fine...
10/24/22, 3:22 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?
10/24/22, 3:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: Put them on your head and ignite for robux
10/24/22, 3:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
10/24/22, 3:22 PM - Ryan: ü•≤
10/24/22, 3:23 PM - Ryan: How severe can the scolding be?
10/24/22, 3:24 PM - Dev: Very
10/24/22, 3:24 PM - Dev: But also
10/24/22, 3:24 PM - Dev: Depends
10/24/22, 3:24 PM - Ryan: Oh no
10/24/22, 3:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: Kuch nahi hoga
10/24/22, 3:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: If Isha mam scolds I'll scold her
10/24/22, 3:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: So 0% chance
10/24/22, 3:28 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: book mein it says that some people believed it was the indian nationalists too
10/24/22, 3:28 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/24/22, 3:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: Did the British colonialists really introduce rule of law
10/24/22, 3:29 PM - Ryan: Yes historians disputed the claim that the britishers introduced the Rule of Law in India
10/24/22, 3:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: Exactly
10/24/22, 3:29 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i remember my father told me he used to get hit by scales on his hand from his teacher
10/24/22, 3:29 PM - Ryan: I don't know

Historians still dispute over that
10/24/22, 3:29 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: cause hw nahi kiya
10/24/22, 3:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: Define rule of law
10/24/22, 3:29 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yes
10/24/22, 3:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: Read sedition act
10/24/22, 3:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: Where is the dispute
10/24/22, 3:30 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW
10/24/22, 3:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/24/22, 3:30 PM - Ryan: Sometimes there are cases when students are beated to death
10/24/22, 3:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: And what was sedition act
10/24/22, 3:30 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: damn omg
10/24/22, 3:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: My granddad's teacher beat him so he beat the shit out of him back
10/24/22, 3:30 PM - Ryan: What is the difference between Sedition Act and Rowlatt Act?
10/24/22, 3:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: @919717944490
10/24/22, 3:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: Due to sedition act, Rule of Law was not present in the colonial times
10/24/22, 3:31 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: I still dont know lmao
10/24/22, 3:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: There were probably many other state enforcements which were not complying with rule of law
10/24/22, 3:31 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: same thing about british arbitariness
10/24/22, 3:31 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: wait i think i told you that day
10/24/22, 3:32 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: there was a difference
10/24/22, 3:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: arbitrariness
10/24/22, 3:32 PM - Ryan: An Act by the Britishers that allowed allowed British officers to arrest any persons that were going against national interest, raising a rebellion or resistance. The persons were arrested without due trial and the British had a very broad definition of Sedition

??
10/24/22, 3:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: allowed allowed
10/24/22, 3:32 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/24/22, 3:32 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: allowed allowed
10/24/22, 3:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: So do you think that was in compliance with the idea of Rule of Law?
10/24/22, 3:33 PM - Ryan: English issue
10/24/22, 3:33 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: minor
10/24/22, 3:33 PM - Ryan: It was arbitrary surely

But was it against the Rule of Law
10/24/22, 3:33 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: are you A minor? because *A minor on piano plays*
10/24/22, 3:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: Did they do it with officers?
10/24/22, 3:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: Officials
10/24/22, 3:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: And other British people
10/24/22, 3:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: And that's your answer
10/24/22, 3:34 PM - Ryan: Why

It was for the benefit of the British
10/24/22, 3:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: I am asking you to elaborate
10/24/22, 3:34 PM - Ryan: Why would the British rebel against British
10/24/22, 3:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ofcourse it was for their benefit
10/24/22, 3:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: Wahi t≈ç...
10/24/22, 3:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: So the Sedition act didn't apply to them?
10/24/22, 3:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: You're saying that right?
10/24/22, 3:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: And that should tell you that the arbitrariness of it was against Rule of Law
10/24/22, 3:35 PM - Ryan: Technically it still applied to all the citizens

But aimed for the Indians who were protesting against the British government
10/24/22, 3:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: "applied"
10/24/22, 3:36 PM - Ryan: Why would it

What act of Sedition did they commit?
10/24/22, 3:36 PM - Ryan: Grammar issue
10/24/22, 3:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: When did I say it would...
10/24/22, 3:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: Not a grammar issue
10/24/22, 3:36 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/24/22, 3:36 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: some old lady sent me a montage of diwali videos w
10/24/22, 3:36 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: what
10/24/22, 3:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: I am pointing it out
10/24/22, 3:36 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: what is going on
10/24/22, 3:36 PM - Ryan: That there is no grammar issue above
10/24/22, 3:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: There are
10/24/22, 3:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: I am talking about that specific word
10/24/22, 3:36 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/24/22, 3:36 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
10/24/22, 3:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: like randomly
10/24/22, 3:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: I put it in quotes because it's meaningless. It apparently applies but it doesn't.
10/24/22, 3:37 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?
10/24/22, 3:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: Sure about what?
10/24/22, 3:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes I am sure it didn't apply to the Britishers themselves because it was for their own benefit
10/24/22, 3:37 PM - Ryan: That the Sedition Act wasn't applied on the British
10/24/22, 3:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: They said it should apply to everyone but ofcourse that's bullshit
10/24/22, 3:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
10/24/22, 3:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: this was the video
10/24/22, 3:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: old lady sent
10/24/22, 3:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yeah? It was not applied on them for any real reason, perhaps it was occasionally done to make it seem like it wasn't arbitrary
10/24/22, 3:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: But that's a hypothetical example
10/24/22, 3:38 PM - Ryan: Was in there particular statement in the Act that mentioned the British were excluded from the Sedition Act


They could still legally be put under Sedition right?
10/24/22, 3:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: YES
10/24/22, 3:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: they could legally be put under sedition act
10/24/22, 3:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: legally
10/24/22, 3:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: but they would never actually be
10/24/22, 3:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: guys are you tard
10/24/22, 3:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: so rule of law effectively did not exist
10/24/22, 3:38 PM - Dev: Dm dhek
10/24/22, 3:39 PM - Ryan: Probably
10/24/22, 3:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: What probably?
10/24/22, 3:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: I'm trying to say it the whole time
10/24/22, 3:39 PM - Ryan: But it did exist right?

Although it was empty
10/24/22, 3:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: that's why I put it in quotes
10/24/22, 3:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: "applied"
10/24/22, 3:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: because it did not apply
10/24/22, 3:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes North Korea is democratic
10/24/22, 3:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: They have elections
10/24/22, 3:40 PM - Ryan: The concept was there but not effectively executed
10/24/22, 3:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: They have democratic people's republic in their name
10/24/22, 3:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: It was _purposefully_ not executed
10/24/22, 3:40 PM - Ryan: So the British still introduced the concept of Rule of Law in India?

The mere concept?
10/24/22, 3:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: üôè
10/24/22, 3:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/24/22, 3:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: They introduced the concept
10/24/22, 3:41 PM - Ryan: Ok
10/24/22, 3:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: Just like I can say quantum mechanics to a 7 year old and I have introduced to him the concept of quantum mechanics
10/24/22, 3:41 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/24/22, 3:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: Same way the British introduce the concept
10/24/22, 3:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: I could tell you a word randomly without telling you it's meaning and I would still have introduced you it's concept, couldn't I?
10/24/22, 3:43 PM - Ryan: They introduced the concept

But the development of the concept was done by the Indians?

The actual application of the concept?
10/24/22, 3:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: Honestly some dude must've already figured out Rule of Law way before the Britishers arrived. May not have applied it, but if we're going with such a weak definition of "introduced", that dude still would have introduced it
10/24/22, 3:44 PM - Ryan: You would have to tell the definition too right?

"Banana"

"What is a banana"

"This yellow long curved nutritious fruit which you have to eat by peeling"
10/24/22, 3:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: Exactly
10/24/22, 3:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: For most people I would have to explain the definition too to make it an "introduction"
10/24/22, 3:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: But here, you have used a very weak definition of "introduced"
10/24/22, 3:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: So I am using same definition
10/24/22, 3:45 PM - Ryan: The definition was there right?

But the people didn't know about it?
10/24/22, 3:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: And if we further take the same definition, you could pick other examples of Indian history from the past

For that you'll have to study all of it to find a meaningful answer
10/24/22, 3:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: So my suggestion - use a better definition of "introduced", and then it would not have been the Britishers but the INC to first introduce the Rule of Law
10/24/22, 3:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: I did not understand
10/24/22, 3:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ok tl;dr:
Saying a word _doesn't_ mean you've introduced it, it means you've said the word

The Britishers did not implement the concept, nor dis they ever intend to make any form of system to help support the implementation of the concept either

The INC was the first to effectively introduce the concept
10/24/22, 3:48 PM - Ryan: The concept was there and it's definition was there of legislation right?

The definition mentioned in British documents regarding administration and law? Wasn't it there?

They introduced the concept to administration in India right?
10/24/22, 3:48 PM - Ryan: I am stupid

I don't know most of things I speak about
10/24/22, 3:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: Fine
10/24/22, 3:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: They may have also introduced it
10/24/22, 3:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: They may have not
10/24/22, 3:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: It's not clear because their introduction was very vague
10/24/22, 3:49 PM - Ryan: Wait that's illegal
10/24/22, 3:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/24/22, 3:50 PM - Ryan: Au revoir

10/25/22, 12:13 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: it was super realistic
10/25/22, 12:13 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: do you want to know?
10/25/22, 12:14 PM - Ryan: What

Why

How
10/25/22, 12:14 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: I dont know lmao, this is the 2nd dream about you
10/25/22, 12:14 PM - Ryan: Ok
10/25/22, 12:16 PM - Ryan: But why?

Is it normal?
10/25/22, 12:17 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: I dont even know at this point
10/25/22, 12:17 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: random dreams
10/25/22, 12:17 PM - Ryan: Hmm ok
10/25/22, 12:17 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: I have had about 10-15 dreams with anant
10/25/22, 12:17 PM - Ryan: What was the dream
10/25/22, 12:17 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: and a few with dev, aditya
10/25/22, 12:18 PM - Ryan: hmm

This doesn't seem normal to me
10/25/22, 12:18 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i dont know
10/25/22, 12:18 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i woke up scared
10/25/22, 12:20 PM - Ryan: Any faint memory
10/25/22, 12:21 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: we woke up in this house, it was very messy. It was a very small room actually
military style, a whole power gen taking up his rooms space and small carpet on the floor as his bed

i said "amazing crib buddy"
and then we walked into a small room, you said "another crib haha"

and then it was a 20ft pipe which we had to go through

then we fell and landed in my prev society?!??!
we were taking a walk and we talked about chemistry

you said "meth haha funny"

then for some reason i tp'd to my house and we were in a discord call

you were screen sharing, I asked you "do you do meth?"
"ryan"
"yo buddy?"

then you go to a server with glitched minecraft characters as its name and then on to pinned messages
there was a shitty meme and i said "ah yes intellectual meme aaahahaah please stop"

i dont know why

you then scrolled down a bit more and there was an image with my reflection on the photo, the reflection was like a mirror

it said "the person below this text shall be awarded death"

and i was like "bro meth kar rahe ho kya, kya hua"

I ACTUALLY EXPLODED OVER THERE AND I WAS BEHEADED, I COULD SEE MY LIMBS APART BUT I WAS STILL ALIVE
SO MUCH BLOOD AROUND

then you come up to me and says "no one shall know about my meth secrets"
10/25/22, 12:22 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: "his" refers to you

i sent this to anant first so i had to change "his/him" to "you"
10/25/22, 12:22 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i still have a photographic memory
10/25/22, 12:22 PM - Ryan: Hmm very detailed
10/25/22, 12:23 PM - Ryan: Your memory very strong
10/25/22, 12:23 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yes, i think there was more but dementia
10/25/22, 12:23 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: there was more, i forgot after i woke up
10/25/22, 12:23 PM - Ryan: Hmm ok
10/25/22, 12:23 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: what dreams do you have
10/25/22, 12:23 PM - Ryan: But why do you dream about persons
10/25/22, 12:24 PM - Ryan: I don't know

I forget them
10/25/22, 12:24 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: its not up to me to decide
10/25/22, 12:24 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: my brain just plays whatever goes on in my mind
10/25/22, 12:24 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/25/22, 12:24 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: most of the times, yes
10/25/22, 12:25 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: because i can't go to sleep asking my brain to make me dream about xyz
10/25/22, 12:25 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: lucid dreaming maybe
10/25/22, 12:25 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: have you ever had a lucid dream?
10/25/22, 12:26 PM - Navya: yes
10/25/22, 12:26 PM - Navya: in my dream i was like
10/25/22, 12:26 PM - Navya: shree wake up
10/25/22, 12:26 PM - Ryan: What is that?

10/25/22, 12:26 PM - Navya: u can control ur dream
10/25/22, 12:26 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: interesting thing
10/25/22, 12:27 PM - Dev: User name Bata de
10/25/22, 12:27 PM - Aditya Vardhan: no
10/25/22, 12:27 PM - Dev: Kyu?
10/25/22, 12:28 PM - Aditya Vardhan: pta nahi he
10/25/22, 12:28 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: hahaha
10/25/22, 12:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
10/25/22, 12:28 PM - Dev: Accha
10/25/22, 12:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: mildly edit
10/25/22, 12:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: some random dreams very detailed
10/25/22, 12:28 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: severe
10/25/22, 12:28 PM - Navya: DUDE WHY MY MOM IS LISTENING TO "TERI DUNIYA SE MAJAOOR HOKAR BAHUT DUR CHALA"
10/25/22, 12:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: i do too
10/25/22, 12:28 PM - Aditya Vardhan: i dont know
10/25/22, 12:28 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: how are we supposed to know
10/25/22, 12:28 PM - Ryan: That seems wierd
10/25/22, 12:29 PM - Navya: arrre it's a sad song
10/25/22, 12:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: lucid dreams are not well understood nor clear to everyone. many people have different definitions of it's perceptions
10/25/22, 12:29 PM - Navya: is she missing my MAMU?
10/25/22, 12:29 PM - Navya: prolly
10/25/22, 12:29 PM - Aditya Vardhan: lucid dreams
10/25/22, 12:29 PM - Aditya Vardhan: yes
10/25/22, 12:29 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: spider man
10/25/22, 12:29 PM - Aditya Vardhan: i ate a ghost
10/25/22, 12:29 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: damn bro
10/25/22, 12:29 PM - Navya: wtf lmaooo
10/25/22, 12:29 PM - Aditya Vardhan: so let me explain my dream
10/25/22, 12:29 PM - Aditya Vardhan: anant knows
10/25/22, 12:29 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: and then? did you shit it out too?
10/25/22, 12:29 PM - Navya: I once saw I killed jw and ate him
10/25/22, 12:30 PM - Aditya Vardhan: i woke up
10/25/22, 12:30 PM - Navya: bechare bccha
10/25/22, 12:30 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: Ok
10/25/22, 12:30 PM - Aditya Vardhan: so i was having a nightmare i woke up
10/25/22, 12:30 PM - Aditya Vardhan: i slept again
10/25/22, 12:30 PM - Navya: sleep paralysis?
10/25/22, 12:30 PM - Aditya Vardhan: i had the same dream
10/25/22, 12:30 PM - Navya: anyone?
10/25/22, 12:30 PM - Aditya Vardhan: again
10/25/22, 12:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: i had a lucid dream once (atleast according to me ill call it a lucid dream) and it was awesome üòéüòéüòé

then i woke up and the realisation kicked in more that it was a lucid dream

then extreme sadness
10/25/22, 12:31 PM - Navya: idk what was that but I think it was sleep paralysis only it was scary
10/25/22, 12:31 PM - Aditya Vardhan: but this time i knew that it was a dream
10/25/22, 12:31 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: reoccuring dream
10/25/22, 12:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: i felt kinda terrible for the rest of the day lol
10/25/22, 12:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: ive had 2-3 in total
10/25/22, 12:31 PM - Aditya Vardhan: the tables turned
10/25/22, 12:31 PM - Aditya Vardhan: i started scaring the ghost
10/25/22, 12:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: and 2 sleep paralys√≠

10/25/22, 2:28 PM - Navya: LMAAOAOAOAOAOA
10/25/22, 2:46 PM - Tanmaya: What is sleep paralysis?
10/25/22, 2:46 PM - Ryan: Why are dreams so wierd?

Why do you remember your dreams
10/25/22, 2:46 PM - Ryan: @919999373163
10/25/22, 2:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: when brain half awake
10/25/22, 2:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: your body cant move but you still experience the dream
10/25/22, 2:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: usually a nightmare
10/25/22, 2:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: well
10/25/22, 2:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: many people remember their dreams
10/25/22, 2:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: especially if traumatising
10/25/22, 2:49 PM - Tanmaya: Huh
10/25/22, 2:49 PM - Tanmaya: What
10/25/22, 2:49 PM - Tanmaya: Scary
10/25/22, 2:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
10/25/22, 2:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: like your eyes open
10/25/22, 2:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: but cant move at all
10/25/22, 2:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: i remember i once had when i was 6

i saw some ghosty thing in the dark, tried speaking to my brother but couldn't
10/25/22, 2:50 PM - Navya: It's like
10/25/22, 2:50 PM - Navya: You cant move you are paralyzed
10/25/22, 2:50 PM - Navya: and you can only move your eyes
10/25/22, 2:51 PM - Navya: or sometimes not even that
10/25/22, 2:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes that was me
10/25/22, 2:51 PM - Navya: u heard weird voices
10/25/22, 2:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: not always
10/25/22, 2:51 PM - Tanmaya: Ok stop
10/25/22, 2:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: i just saw very scary
10/25/22, 2:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
10/25/22, 2:51 PM - Navya: or screams
10/25/22, 2:51 PM - Tanmaya: Very scary
10/25/22, 2:51 PM - Navya: Ohhh..
10/25/22, 2:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: alfred aajayega
10/25/22, 2:51 PM - Navya: yup
10/25/22, 2:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: and you'll be paralysed
10/25/22, 2:51 PM - Navya: LMAO
10/25/22, 2:51 PM - Tanmaya: Please chup ho jao
10/25/22, 2:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: you'll wake up at 3 AM
10/25/22, 2:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: then try to scream
10/25/22, 2:51 PM - Tanmaya left
10/25/22, 2:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: while alfred runs around your room
10/25/22, 2:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: üòÄ
10/25/22, 2:52 PM - Navya: alfred is cute
10/25/22, 2:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
10/25/22, 2:52 PM - Navya: üëª
10/25/22, 2:52 PM - Navya: isn't this emo cute
10/25/22, 2:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: no its scary
10/25/22, 2:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: sleep paralysis
10/25/22, 3:09 PM - Ryan: Oxford University is older than the Aztec Empire?
10/25/22, 3:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/25/22, 3:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: It's weird
10/25/22, 3:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: Aztec Empire seems very archaic
10/25/22, 3:10 PM - Ryan: Very wierd
10/25/22, 3:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: Well Oxford University was nothing special so it's a matter of picking the correct empire, an old but somewhat major university
10/25/22, 3:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: nothing special at creation ig*
10/25/22, 3:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: I think Oxford was before Anglo norman period so that's what I guess
10/25/22, 3:16 PM - Ryan: Hmm what is the Anglo-Norman period?
10/25/22, 3:17 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: its only for 2-3 days and then i forget it, except one dream
there's this dream i still remember

dreams are weird, probably because the content we see online and in our daily life gets mixed and then it plaays like a movie idk honestly thats what i was told
10/25/22, 3:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: so some armies ganged up and invaded england, led by duke of normandy, made of french and flemming and some other ethnicities in 1050s approx

and then major cultural shift

england was exposed to more european culture

anglonorman period for the next 2 centuries because that's when most of the transition happened

so many things shifted
10/25/22, 3:22 PM - Ryan: Ok
10/25/22, 3:24 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: my reaction to that information moment hogaya
10/25/22, 3:25 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 why do we use hand gestures while talking?
10/25/22, 3:25 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: why not
10/25/22, 3:25 PM - Ryan: Why?
10/25/22, 3:26 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: imagine you're giving a presentation with your hands still
10/25/22, 3:26 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: according to you, how would it feel
10/25/22, 3:26 PM - Ryan: Why use muscles unnecessarily

Brain also using energy

Using your arms would be a waste of energy at that moment right?
10/25/22, 3:26 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: waste of energy just by using hand gestures? what
10/25/22, 3:27 PM - Ryan: I don't know

Is even my presence necessary?

What if it was only my voice explaining the slides
10/25/22, 3:27 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: its not like you're gonna get too tired or fall because you "Wasted" energy by using hand gestures
10/25/22, 3:27 PM - Ryan: Not by a large amount

But why use our hands
10/25/22, 3:27 PM - Ryan: What do they mean?
10/25/22, 3:27 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: presentable lagta hai when someone uses hand gestures ig
10/25/22, 3:27 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/25/22, 3:28 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: hmmm
10/25/22, 3:28 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i have seen people present with and without hand gestures
10/25/22, 3:29 PM - Ryan: People

Why need people during presentations?
10/25/22, 3:29 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: people who talk with hand gestures, they seem warm and agreeable for some reason
10/25/22, 3:29 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: animals! or insects too
10/25/22, 3:29 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: and the ones who don't seem cold and analytical
10/25/22, 3:29 PM - Ryan: What if it was just an animation

More flexible, more potential than a human being right?
10/25/22, 3:29 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: diff
10/25/22, 3:30 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yea true
10/25/22, 3:30 PM - Ryan: They seem wierd to me
10/25/22, 3:30 PM - Ryan: I can't understand the use of these
10/25/22, 3:30 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: then don't
10/25/22, 3:30 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: some times its just a reflex
10/25/22, 3:30 PM - Ryan: Why
10/25/22, 3:31 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: if you don't want to use hand gestures while presenting or speaking then don't
10/25/22, 3:31 PM - Ryan: Why not?
10/25/22, 3:31 PM - Ryan: Make me understand why not?
10/25/22, 3:31 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: do you want to use hand gestures while presenting or speaking?
10/25/22, 3:31 PM - Ryan: No
10/25/22, 3:32 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i just told you, there is a difference between people who use hand gestures. You can tell a lot about them already
10/25/22, 3:32 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: it is recommended to
10/25/22, 3:33 PM - Navya: @917838968821 add tanmaya
10/25/22, 3:34 PM - Ryan: What is the difference

Make me understand the difference
10/25/22, 3:34 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: :D
10/25/22, 3:34 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: confidence too maybe
10/25/22, 3:35 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
10/25/22, 3:35 PM - Ryan: I don't know confident people How they are different from others?

I don't know cold people, how are they different from others?
10/25/22, 3:35 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ah yes confidence
10/25/22, 3:36 PM - Ryan: But really, is it necessary to use hand gestures to display yourself as confident
10/25/22, 3:36 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: not necessary
10/25/22, 3:36 PM - Ryan: Then why use it
10/25/22, 3:36 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: my braincells are decreasing please stop
10/25/22, 3:36 PM - Ryan: No
10/25/22, 3:37 PM - Ryan: You have more braincells than me
10/25/22, 3:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: No i don't
10/25/22, 3:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i dont know chemical names that you mention
10/25/22, 3:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i dont know half of the questions that you ask anant
10/25/22, 3:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i dont get good marks
10/25/22, 3:37 PM - Ryan: How does that relate to braincells?
10/25/22, 3:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: wnat aeh
10/25/22, 3:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: functional tissue!
10/25/22, 3:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: mine isn't functioning
10/25/22, 3:38 PM - Ryan: Yes

You have that functional tissue
10/25/22, 3:38 PM - Ryan: You are just lazy probably
10/25/22, 3:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: not more than yours
10/25/22, 3:38 PM - Ryan: And distracted
10/25/22, 3:39 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ah yes
10/25/22, 3:39 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: this feels like that one motivation video
10/25/22, 3:39 PM - Ryan: I believe you and I have the same brain cells
10/25/22, 3:39 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: "you're lazy and distracted, get up and give me 200 pushups"
10/25/22, 3:39 PM - Ryan: You might need a better blood flow to supply your brain cells with enough energy
10/25/22, 3:39 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: interesting
10/25/22, 3:39 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: help me with that
10/25/22, 3:39 PM - Ryan: Exercise
10/25/22, 3:40 PM - Ryan: Good for marks üëç
10/25/22, 3:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: noted
10/25/22, 3:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: what else
10/25/22, 3:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: good diet?
10/25/22, 3:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: less time from gadgets?
10/25/22, 3:41 PM - Ryan: üëç
10/25/22, 3:41 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: noted
10/25/22, 3:41 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: 1 week
10/25/22, 3:49 PM - Ryan: 1 year
10/25/22, 4:21 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 which protein is broken down to form putrescine?
10/25/22, 4:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: yeah it's called a video
10/25/22, 4:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: most people watch videos now
10/25/22, 4:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: many don't because videos are not the fastest way
10/25/22, 4:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: but they are fun
10/25/22, 4:22 PM - Ryan: I am not sure if even the question is correct

But I need an answer
10/25/22, 4:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: with a live talk, you're Going to have the feeling "i paid moeny for this, i should focus"
10/25/22, 4:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: not much energy is used
10/25/22, 4:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: and thus your body doesn't really care that much
10/25/22, 4:23 PM - Ryan: Yes not much
10/25/22, 4:23 PM - Ryan: The brain takes a lot of energy
10/25/22, 4:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: hand movement may help viewer visualise it
10/25/22, 4:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yrs
10/25/22, 4:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: Compared to a bit of hand movement
10/25/22, 4:23 PM - Ryan: Is it necessary
10/25/22, 4:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
10/25/22, 4:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: Videos are not that necessary, most people don't have aphantasia and can imagine animations of diagrams

Heck why even use a picture. Just write in small text print where an object is supposed to be and let reader visualize the diagram
10/25/22, 4:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: "it's the most page efficient way" after all
10/25/22, 4:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: but ofcourse that makes it hard to visualize
10/25/22, 4:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: imagine if every diagram was simply a text description
10/25/22, 4:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: why not use a bit of extra page space and make it so much easier to parse the information
10/25/22, 4:25 PM - Ryan: What happens when L-ornithine is broken down through carboxylation (I am not sure if this question is correct)
10/25/22, 4:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: why not use a bit extra energy to move hands and visualize information
10/25/22, 4:25 PM - Ryan: Why hands
10/25/22, 4:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
10/25/22, 4:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: i can't add her
10/25/22, 4:25 PM - Ryan: Why not just images and animations
10/25/22, 4:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yeah
10/25/22, 4:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: Read a textbook
10/25/22, 4:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: Watch a video
10/25/22, 4:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: Why even go to a presentation if it's just a video
10/25/22, 4:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: There is the internet
10/25/22, 4:26 PM - Navya: send her link
10/25/22, 4:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ye ok
10/25/22, 4:26 PM - Navya: she told me to add u
10/25/22, 4:26 PM - Navya: I mean herrrr
10/25/22, 4:26 PM - Ryan: Yes why

Unless if the person is important
10/25/22, 4:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: Well the person being important doesn't matter
10/25/22, 4:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: Videos are more efficient
10/25/22, 4:27 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/25/22, 4:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: No, infact I know it's incorrect
10/25/22, 4:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: I am using your logic
10/25/22, 4:27 PM - Ryan: What is my logix
10/25/22, 4:27 PM - Ryan: logic*
10/25/22, 4:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: Someone perceived as important is an emotion

Emotions are not efficient
10/25/22, 4:27 PM - Ryan: What is logic
10/25/22, 4:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: Logic is how a problem should be analysed and approached
10/25/22, 4:28 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/25/22, 4:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: No!
10/25/22, 4:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: I know it's wrong!!!
10/25/22, 4:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: We go to presentations because it's fun, a social activity too
10/25/22, 4:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: Feels better than watching a video which can't interact with you
10/25/22, 4:28 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/25/22, 4:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes that's what I would go for
10/25/22, 4:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: And sometimes we want fun not 100% efficiency
10/25/22, 4:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: Colleges... well... yeah idk
10/25/22, 4:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: Education system is inefficient
10/25/22, 4:29 PM - Ryan: Sometimes?
10/25/22, 4:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: But online isn't that much better because most people don't bother being 100% efficient
10/25/22, 4:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yeah?
10/25/22, 4:29 PM - Ryan: Can it?

What is an interaction?
10/25/22, 4:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: Can it? From my experience, yes, sometimes
10/25/22, 4:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: An interaction... I don't know, I think it's pretty intuitive
10/25/22, 4:30 PM - Ryan: Most of the times we want 100% efficiency
10/25/22, 4:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: You want 100% efficiency
10/25/22, 4:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: Then go do it
10/25/22, 4:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: Type as fast as possible
10/25/22, 4:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: Don't waste any time
10/25/22, 4:30 PM - Ryan: No
10/25/22, 4:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: Throw your phone and land it perfectly and open the exact page of the book you need to read, if any
10/25/22, 4:31 PM - Ryan: Is that really efficient

Typing really fast
10/25/22, 4:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: Analyse every problem perfectly
10/25/22, 4:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/25/22, 4:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: It is
10/25/22, 4:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: for many people
10/25/22, 4:31 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/25/22, 4:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: 100% efficiency is difficult...
10/25/22, 4:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes, infact I'd say I'm one
10/25/22, 4:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: Typing faster requires less effort because you start to rely more on word patterns, and touch typing
10/25/22, 4:31 PM - Ryan: More prone to errors? more mistakes? More misunderstanding?
10/25/22, 4:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: Learn to type faster
10/25/22, 4:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: Try harder
10/25/22, 4:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: But ofcourse it's not easy
10/25/22, 4:32 PM - Ryan: Can we learn to think faster?
10/25/22, 4:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: So people don't try it
10/25/22, 4:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/25/22, 4:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: Learn to prune useless thoughts
10/25/22, 4:32 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/25/22, 4:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes, most people can to some extent
10/25/22, 4:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: Figure out your priorities
10/25/22, 4:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: Learn what is the right time to do things
10/25/22, 4:32 PM - Ryan: That is controlling your thoughts right?
10/25/22, 4:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: I am not good at any of them
10/25/22, 4:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/25/22, 4:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: I cannot do any of these, I don't think most people can
10/25/22, 4:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't try to be 100% efficient
10/25/22, 4:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: That is why I will sometimes choose to go to a presentation
10/25/22, 4:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: With hand gestures
10/25/22, 4:33 PM - Ryan: The speed of thought requires a more efficient brain

Or does it?
10/25/22, 4:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
10/25/22, 4:33 PM - Ryan: It is just the nervous system
10/25/22, 4:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: But it's hard to improve, for most people including me
10/25/22, 4:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: I am not good
10/25/22, 4:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't think we should try to be 100% efficient
10/25/22, 4:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: Or maybe we should
10/25/22, 4:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: But we're lazy
10/25/22, 4:33 PM - Ryan: It has a fixed maximum speed

The speed of thought is limited right?
10/25/22, 4:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: We want to do comfortable things
10/25/22, 4:34 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/25/22, 4:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: Everything is limited as per our current understanding of the universe
10/25/22, 4:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/25/22, 4:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: We're motivated to take the easiest paths
10/25/22, 4:34 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/25/22, 4:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: And now society wants to label that as lazy
10/25/22, 4:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: As per our understanding
10/25/22, 4:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: Maybe
10/25/22, 4:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: Probably not actually. I'll have to read for that
10/25/22, 4:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: I mean being as efficient as possible is in most people's best interest

It makes your life easier

It makes the world better

But it often tires you out aswell
Burns you out
10/25/22, 4:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: We're very limited by our brain
10/25/22, 4:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: Steroids exist to cope with that
10/25/22, 4:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: They have harmful effects
10/25/22, 4:35 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/25/22, 4:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/25/22, 4:35 PM - Ryan: Just brain?
10/25/22, 4:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: You're limited
10/25/22, 4:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: Many things
10/25/22, 4:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: The brain is one example
10/25/22, 4:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: On how to be more efficient
10/25/22, 4:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: We are lazy
10/25/22, 4:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: That limits us from improving as fast as possible
10/25/22, 4:36 PM - Ryan: Does it only depend on the brain?
10/25/22, 4:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
10/25/22, 4:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: It does not
10/25/22, 4:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: We are not the best of what we could be, I think
10/25/22, 4:37 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/25/22, 4:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: I could turn off my phone for 3 hours and study maths
10/25/22, 4:37 PM - Dev: Will PA3 be hard?
10/25/22, 4:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: I think that would help me in life later
10/25/22, 4:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: Depends
10/25/22, 4:37 PM - Ryan: Extremely
10/25/22, 4:37 PM - Tanmaya joined using this group's invite link
10/25/22, 4:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
10/25/22, 4:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: I doubt that

10/25/22, 4:38 PM - Amritansh: Yes
10/25/22, 4:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: What
10/25/22, 4:38 PM - Dev: Or is it?
10/25/22, 4:38 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/25/22, 4:38 PM - Amritansh: Yes
10/25/22, 4:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: No, it's not
10/25/22, 4:38 PM - Amritansh: Yes
10/25/22, 4:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/25/22, 4:38 PM - Dev: Or is it
10/25/22, 4:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
10/25/22, 4:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: Bhau
10/25/22, 4:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: Literally
10/25/22, 4:38 PM - Dev: Killing people is hard
10/25/22, 4:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: But you're not efficient
10/25/22, 4:38 PM - Ryan: It is very difficult
10/25/22, 4:38 PM - Dev: First you got to get to him
10/25/22, 4:38 PM - Amritansh: SOLAR ECLIPSE ALERT üò≠

10/25/22, 4:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: @919717944490 Conclusion: hand gestures are useful because we are lazy
10/25/22, 4:39 PM - Ryan: It is not that simple
10/25/22, 4:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/25/22, 4:39 PM - Dev: üëç
10/25/22, 4:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: Exactly
10/25/22, 4:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: It's a huge question
10/25/22, 4:39 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/25/22, 4:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: Nope
10/25/22, 4:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: Nothing is a conclusion
10/25/22, 4:39 PM - Dev: I think Thursday might be an holiday
10/25/22, 4:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: But you can be more efficient by not going to a presentation
10/25/22, 4:39 PM - Ryan: Are you Sure?
10/25/22, 4:39 PM - Ryan: Is anything a conclusion?
10/25/22, 4:39 PM - Dev: Or can you?
10/25/22, 4:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: Not for now
10/25/22, 4:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: What does this even mean, literally wahi to kaha
10/25/22, 4:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes you can be more efficient
10/25/22, 4:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: I am being inefficient by not studying
10/25/22, 4:40 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/25/22, 4:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: What even is happiness
10/25/22, 4:40 PM - Dev: Or are you
10/25/22, 4:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: It's all a temporary lie
10/25/22, 4:40 PM - Dev: By not studying
10/25/22, 4:40 PM - Dev: You can go outside
10/25/22, 4:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: We should help the world
10/25/22, 4:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: But we are selfish
10/25/22, 4:40 PM - Ryan: Now go study some maths, ssc, science, English, hindi, coding and sanskrit
10/25/22, 4:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/25/22, 4:40 PM - Dev: And make your body more fit
10/25/22, 4:40 PM - Ryan: Why
10/25/22, 4:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: Have a great day Ryan
10/25/22, 4:41 PM - Dev: Which will help you in life
10/25/22, 4:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't know man, the greater good seems great

10/25/22, 4:44 PM - Dev: Ok
10/25/22, 4:44 PM - Ryan: But they do it sexually and it is external fertilization I think
10/25/22, 4:44 PM - Dev: Hm
10/25/22, 4:45 PM - Ryan: The zygote develops into something that starts with p and that later attaches to a surface and then reproduces through budding

Growing into an adult jellyfish I think
10/25/22, 4:45 PM - Dev: external fertilization in frogs, how dose the sperm reach the egg?
10/25/22, 4:45 PM - Ryan: I could be very wrong

10/25/22, 8:29 PM - Ryan: If I needed citric acid then it would be more efficient to just buy from the chemist
10/25/22, 8:29 PM - Ryan: I think it's for knowledge
10/25/22, 8:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: the real question is how does the chemist extract it ü§î
10/25/22, 8:30 PM - Ryan: Yes

10/25/22, 10:37 PM - Ryan: The questions?

Are we allowed to mark them ourselves?
10/25/22, 10:37 PM - Ryan: We can surely create a lot of questions

10/25/22, 10:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: dont mark and dont learn
10/25/22, 10:40 PM - Ryan: But only some of them would be appropriate for the notebook
10/25/22, 10:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: just understand
10/25/22, 10:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: we cant mark every answer
10/25/22, 10:40 PM - Ryan: Yes

10/25/22, 10:41 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: what about after?
10/25/22, 10:41 PM - Ryan: Not completing notebook work?
10/25/22, 10:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: if we understand it its important
10/25/22, 10:41 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: HAHAHHA YES
10/25/22, 10:41 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: meh
10/25/22, 10:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: research skills more important IMO

10/25/22, 10:43 PM - Ryan: Yes

But unfortunately we have to complete notebook work too

10/25/22, 10:44 PM - Ryan: We have a limited duration for completing the work

And exams are coming, focus would on studying the particular subject
10/25/22, 10:44 PM - Dev: Then why notebook work?

10/25/22, 10:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: we can understand things without writing them in notebook
10/25/22, 10:45 PM - Dev: To tell how much you can ratta
10/25/22, 10:45 PM - Aditya Vardhan: This message was deleted
10/25/22, 10:45 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: true
10/25/22, 10:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: and revising from notebook does not really help you develop novel ideas
10/25/22, 10:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: you just reread what you've already written
10/25/22, 10:45 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yes lmao

10/25/22, 10:45 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: innit

10/25/22, 10:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: if you can't remember how to create something on the spot, it means we dont know it properly

10/25/22, 10:46 PM - Dev: That what
10/25/22, 10:46 PM - Ryan: Because it would be too much

10/25/22, 10:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: kinda more difficult
10/25/22, 10:49 PM - Dev: That's what
10/25/22, 10:49 PM - Dev: That's what
10/25/22, 10:50 PM - Ryan: But can freezing truly preserve human life?
10/25/22, 10:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: fro<26>en hamsters were thawed out using microwaves
10/25/22, 10:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: No

10/25/22, 11:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: hi ryanj
10/25/22, 11:13 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 there were a few criterias to be met that makes a law according to ma'am right? (I could have missed some, my hearing is bad)

1. Must be made by authority

2. Must have a punishment for the violation of such law

3. Accepted by people

Is the 3rd criteria really necessary?
10/25/22, 11:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: in our country, there will be heavy protests if not accepted
10/25/22, 11:14 PM - Ryan: What if I live in a tribal community

And the head makes a law that anyone hunting capybaras will be killed

Is that a law even if not accepted by the vast majority of tribal people, but they fear the head because of his powers

And the lack of the tribe's knowledge about basic human rights
10/25/22, 11:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: it is a good law
10/25/22, 11:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: i dont care what the tribe thinks
10/25/22, 11:15 PM - Ryan: But is it a law?
10/25/22, 11:15 PM - Dev: Indian person president of Britain
10/25/22, 11:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes because you can enforce it
10/25/22, 11:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: it wiwll be hard
10/25/22, 11:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: but
10/25/22, 11:15 PM - Ryan: Prime Minister?
10/25/22, 11:15 PM - Dev: Indian colonization?
10/25/22, 11:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: president nahi
10/25/22, 11:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: prime minsiter
10/25/22, 11:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: bhai lmao
10/25/22, 11:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: rishi sunak was born in the UK
10/25/22, 11:15 PM - Dev: Prime Minister *
10/25/22, 11:15 PM - Ryan: And he is pretty rich too
10/25/22, 11:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: also he's a very rich person who is very...
10/25/22, 11:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: exactly
10/25/22, 11:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: that on it's own is not bad but
10/25/22, 11:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: his ideas
10/25/22, 11:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: on economics
10/25/22, 11:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: ...damn
10/25/22, 11:16 PM - Dev: But still maybe some revenge?
10/25/22, 11:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: not good
10/25/22, 11:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: essentially some trickle down economics
10/25/22, 11:16 PM - Ryan: Hmm

How?
10/25/22, 11:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: its a fun idea to think about, but no
10/25/22, 11:16 PM - Dev: Why dose the uterus not explode?
10/25/22, 11:16 PM - Ryan: Why?
10/25/22, 11:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: well he supports trickle down economics to some extent
10/25/22, 11:16 PM - Ryan: The uterus is one of the strongest Organs in the body
10/25/22, 11:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: thats one thing
10/25/22, 11:16 PM - Dev: In development of the kid
10/25/22, 11:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: strong by what measure
10/25/22, 11:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: what is to be strong
10/25/22, 11:17 PM - Dev: Yes
10/25/22, 11:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: it is quite flexible i think, yes
10/25/22, 11:17 PM - Dev: And the brain
10/25/22, 11:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: so can adapt to baby being big and annoying
10/25/22, 11:17 PM - Dev: In strength and unity
10/25/22, 11:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: what is to be strong
10/25/22, 11:17 PM - Ryan: Hmm are you sure

Brain?
10/25/22, 11:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: it is hard to define
10/25/22, 11:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: unity?
10/25/22, 11:17 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/25/22, 11:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: unity of what?
10/25/22, 11:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: it units your organs in their working yes
10/25/22, 11:17 PM - Dev: Bhai joke mara hai
10/25/22, 11:17 PM - Dev: Haso
10/25/22, 11:17 PM - Ryan: Oh
10/25/22, 11:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: .. oh
10/25/22, 11:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: uh
10/25/22, 11:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: :D
10/25/22, 11:18 PM - Ryan: So the 3rd Criterion for law is only needed in a democracy?
10/25/22, 11:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
10/25/22, 11:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: not even that needed
10/25/22, 11:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: but like
10/25/22, 11:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: if its not popular
10/25/22, 11:18 PM - Ryan: So the people must not know of their rights to be effectively controlled?
10/25/22, 11:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: you will have lower chance of getting re-elected
10/25/22, 11:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: and then someone will remove your law
10/25/22, 11:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
10/25/22, 11:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: easily exploitable people
10/25/22, 11:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: in our country its a bit less easy to exploit people than say DPRK
10/25/22, 11:19 PM - Ryan: Are you sure

It's a quite complicated process and a lengthy one for a common man
10/25/22, 11:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes it is complicated
10/25/22, 11:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: but if enough people hate it
10/25/22, 11:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: it wont be well enforced
10/25/22, 11:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: and will eventually be removed
10/25/22, 11:19 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/25/22, 11:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: not someone, by someone i mean the next president
10/25/22, 11:19 PM - Ryan: But only the court can do that right
10/25/22, 11:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: (s)
10/25/22, 11:19 PM - Dev: Female hyneas have a pseudo-penis and testicals
10/25/22, 11:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ok
10/25/22, 11:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: So they will if they find it's unconstitutional
10/25/22, 11:20 PM - Ryan: Hmm the second part I am not sure about
10/25/22, 11:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: Constitution can be amended too to allow removal of certain laws perhaps
10/25/22, 11:20 PM - Ryan: And they give birth through that
10/25/22, 11:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: It's hard yes
10/25/22, 11:20 PM - Dev: I am not as well
10/25/22, 11:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: so more easily
10/25/22, 11:20 PM - Dev: Yeah
10/25/22, 11:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: i hate biology
10/25/22, 11:20 PM - Dev: Lemme google ot
10/25/22, 11:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: they can just... not enforce it
10/25/22, 11:20 PM - Ryan: Pretty painful

Sometimes the baby would die of suffocation in the organ
10/25/22, 11:20 PM - Dev: Female spotted hyenas "have an elongated clitoris that closely resembles the penis of a male,‚Äù Sarah Benson-Amram, a zoologist at the University of Wyoming, says by email. These pseudo-penises or pseudophalluses, as they're called, are paired with "testicles"‚Äîactually fused labia filled with fatty tissue.
10/25/22, 11:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: so it's not necessary to have people's approval but pretty useful
10/25/22, 11:20 PM - Dev: By google
10/25/22, 11:20 PM - Ryan: And it ruptures some times I think in the process
10/25/22, 11:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: bhai
10/25/22, 11:20 PM - Dev: Hm they kught have testicals
10/25/22, 11:21 PM - Dev: Might*

10/25/22, 11:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: now that the chapter has been started
10/25/22, 11:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: lmao

10/25/22, 11:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: How to unread a message
10/25/22, 11:21 PM - Ryan: It is painful

10/25/22, 11:21 PM - Dev: The pseudo pinus might tear while giving birth
10/25/22, 11:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: Alright guys

10/25/22, 11:39 PM - Ryan: Keratin
10/25/22, 11:39 PM - Ryan: ?
10/25/22, 11:40 PM - Dev: I think it is made of the same material which our nails are made of
10/25/22, 11:40 PM - Ryan: I don't know
10/25/22, 11:40 PM - Ryan: And also hair I think
10/25/22, 11:40 PM - Dev: Squids are weird
10/25/22, 11:40 PM - Dev: Hm I donno
10/25/22, 11:40 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/25/22, 11:40 PM - Ryan: Also Telescope Fish

10/25/22, 11:43 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/25/22, 11:43 PM - Dev: I think
10/25/22, 11:43 PM - Ryan: Ok
10/25/22, 11:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't like animals
10/25/22, 11:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't like humans

10/25/22, 11:45 PM - Dev: We are animals
10/25/22, 11:45 PM - Ryan: The tsetse fly causes a lot of death in Africa

I think it transfers a parasite known as T.Brucei Rhodesiense or T. Brucei grandesience (wrong spelling probably) which causes the sleeping sickness
10/25/22, 11:46 PM - Dev: River snakes are fast in water
10/25/22, 11:46 PM - Dev: Like really fast
10/25/22, 11:46 PM - Ryan: *gambiense instead of grandesiense

I am stupid
10/25/22, 11:46 PM - Dev: The mayfly has a lifespan of 24 hours
10/25/22, 11:47 PM - Ryan: I think a Luna moth in its adult stage can't eat

It starves to death I think
10/25/22, 11:47 PM - Dev: Crocodile have a bite force of 5000psi
10/25/22, 11:48 PM - Ryan: Nice
10/25/22, 11:48 PM - Dev: Why?
10/25/22, 11:48 PM - Ryan: I don't know
10/25/22, 11:48 PM - Ryan: It literally can't

But why?
10/25/22, 11:48 PM - Dev: Howling monke
10/25/22, 11:48 PM - Ryan: Loudest mammal
10/25/22, 11:49 PM - Dev: Pygym monke are smol
10/25/22, 11:49 PM - Dev: Yes
10/25/22, 11:49 PM - Dev: Pymgy*
10/25/22, 11:49 PM - Dev: Mandrills are largest monk
10/25/22, 11:49 PM - Dev: Monke*
10/25/22, 11:49 PM - Ryan: And one last fact


Zebras are violent
10/25/22, 11:50 PM - Dev: How?
10/25/22, 11:52 PM - Ryan: Equipped with kicks that can kill a lion with a strike to the head

Zebras also kills baby zebras to get a chance to mate

They will also beat the pregnant zebra until miscarriage

They are also related to donkeys

Donkeys can be pretty aggressive too, especially when it comes to dogs
10/25/22, 11:53 PM - Dev: For my last fact

The spikes on a pufferfish are it's bones
10/25/22, 11:53 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/25/22, 11:53 PM - Dev: Girrafs can also kill lions with there kicks

10/25/22, 11:53 PM - Dev: Girrafs toungs are black
10/25/22, 11:54 PM - Ryan: Which protects it from the harsh sun rays
10/25/22, 11:54 PM - Ryan: The tongue atleast
10/25/22, 11:54 PM - Dev: Yes
10/25/22, 11:54 PM - Dev: camels have bug eyelashes to protect them from sand srorms
10/25/22, 11:54 PM - Dev: Storms*
10/25/22, 11:55 PM - Ryan: And also their have thick lips to protect them from Cactus needles

And their mouth also looks wierd

The neede-like pink structures in the mouth help the camel to eat Cactus I think
10/25/22, 11:56 PM - Ryan: And they can drink 50 gallons of water when they are extremely thirsty I think
10/25/22, 11:56 PM - Dev: School told us they store water in there humks
10/25/22, 11:56 PM - Dev: But they store fat
10/25/22, 11:56 PM - Dev: Yes
10/25/22, 11:56 PM - Dev: I think you are correct
10/25/22, 11:56 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/25/22, 11:57 PM - Dev: Aumaks eat elephant poop
10/25/22, 11:57 PM - Dev: Animals *
10/25/22, 11:57 PM - Ryan: Why
10/25/22, 11:58 PM - Dev: I donno
10/26/22, 12:00 AM - Ryan: For the last fact

Vultures have a bald head because they start from the soft tissue first while eating, which is the anus through which the pull the internal Organs like intestines out

They bury their head inside the dead bodies I think
10/26/22, 12:09 AM - Anant Tiwari: @919717944490 Why use Heron's formula when you can use trigonometry

10/26/22, 10:16 AM - Aditya Vardhan: looking like a billi
10/26/22, 10:16 AM - Anant Tiwari: did I say something stupid
10/26/22, 10:16 AM - Anant Tiwari: tail
10/26/22, 10:16 AM - Anant Tiwari: but no it's monkey i think
10/26/22, 10:16 AM - Anant Tiwari: weird hand
10/26/22, 10:16 AM - Aditya Vardhan: billi long limbs>?
10/26/22, 10:16 AM - Anant Tiwari: cat has small leg
10/26/22, 10:16 AM - Anant Tiwari: No
10/26/22, 10:16 AM - Anant Tiwari: Exactly
10/26/22, 10:16 AM - Anant Tiwari: I am stupid!
10/26/22, 12:26 PM - Dev: People say that skeletons are scary
10/26/22, 12:27 PM - Dev: But I think a muscle structure would be more scary
10/26/22, 12:27 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ah yes
10/26/22, 12:35 PM - Dev: An octopus has copper in its blood
10/26/22, 12:55 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 what is the working of the Biological water filter experiment?
10/26/22, 12:55 PM - Navya: I miss living in delhi tho
10/26/22, 12:55 PM - Navya: there were so many monkes
10/26/22, 12:56 PM - Ryan: And how do you get better at practicals?
10/26/22, 12:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: I have not done it
10/26/22, 12:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: Quantify what's difficult in them and then fix them
10/26/22, 12:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: I am not good at them either
10/26/22, 12:57 PM - Ryan: I did it

And the final yield was less than 10 percent because I am bad at practicals
10/26/22, 12:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: 10% what? What are you measuring? I have not done the experiment
10/26/22, 12:57 PM - Ryan: The banana or orange peels weren't there in the kit
10/26/22, 12:57 PM - Ryan: Of water
10/26/22, 12:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: That might not be your problem but school's problem
10/26/22, 12:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: And you can tell teacher about it ig
10/26/22, 12:59 PM - Ryan: But practical needs material right

But the material is limited
10/26/22, 1:02 PM - Ryan: Practical knowledge needs experience right

How could we get the experience?
10/26/22, 2:38 PM - Parth: Yes monkey

10/26/22, 5:01 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i have answers for a few of these q's
10/26/22, 5:01 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: but later
10/26/22, 5:01 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: anant will prolly answer
10/26/22, 5:02 PM - Ryan: Why

Why not now
10/26/22, 5:02 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: busy
10/26/22, 5:02 PM - Ryan: Oh ok
10/26/22, 5:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: i hate you
10/26/22, 5:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: okay buddy so
10/26/22, 5:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: body in biology is the set of living components which are interdependent on each other to function completely

body in politics is a collection of people which do something. political bodies

bodies in physics generally mean objects

bodies can also sometimes refer to observes of consciousness

all depends on the context

a fire is a result of a type of exothermic redox reaction called combustion. fire is usually what we observe from it - the flame, temperature, changes brought in surroundings by that reaction

sugar is a class of molecules
a bean is some food obtained from a biological family of plants, which probably have some similar characteristics, i don't know
i cannot define a berry due to my lack of knowledge on this

well for everyday use, because most fruits are not great when cooked, are usually sweeter etc

quantum is a word derived from latin for quantity, but nowadays it's used to mean "very small things" as the basis of modern quantum mechanics was about light appearing to come in packets. now these packets had a fixed size, so related to quantity, they were called quanta (later photons) and since quantum mechanics mainly happens at microscopic levels, it's used to mean small

there are many life forms without emotions. emotions is not necessary for survival, many of those life forms are dumb, essentially pre-programmed to perform certain actions based on certain surroundings

but for more complex life, well those which developed emotions seemed to live longer. part of this was that emotions have a general tendency of being adaptable more than a dumb chain of cells which, since their behaviour is more wired, are more likely to survive. and once you survive, more of yourselfs = more of the gene pool has your traits ie more things have emotions

behaviour? Behaviour is a wide term. I think a somewhat decent definition for it is how things respond to conditions? Atleast that's my guess. Behaviour is caused by your brain structure or whatever allows you to control yourself, and as I discussed above, behaviour may be more beneficial in keeping you alive and letting you reproduce

natural instincts are there because behaviour is complicated, messy, unpredictable. and for earlier life, their instincts were their only thing. they helped them survive as these instincts helped them do things to keep them longer. heat = move these parts in a way so you move away, so you survive, and now you can reproduce, your offsprings also now know slightly better on what to do in what condition of your body

even now, despite our more evolved brain, we are still not able to fight these instincts due to them being set so hard in our brain's chemistry.

can math be memorised? Well math is pretty vague - there are many aspects of math. it's a form of abstraction, it helps you define and write about things which go on in the world. maths is a pretty fundamental language of the universe. but the script used by us humans is not the true nature of maths, ofcourse. the ideas of maths exists there in the universe. things like calculus don't exist directly but they are tools of our script of math which help us abstract complicated observations into more manageable pieces. but yeah, maths is a pretty vague thing. what is there to memorise in maths?

there are some tools provided by math which allow you to make better observations. derivative and integration rules, taylor series, other forms of constructed functions which work on abstractions. for example, the identities representing binomial multiplication don't directly say anything about the universe, or about the maths part itself. but it helps us slow humans use these abstractions more quickly

but a major invention of the 20th century (and arguably, before the 20th century, but let's not get into computing history) was the computer. and these computers just did calculations at first. that was their use, to make life easier for us. do you really need to know binomial multiplication identities to "learn" maths? Learning maths is about understanding the concepts, so you can apply them to make predictions about nature, and things like that.

Does memorising the identity help you at all? It helps you simplify expressions but we can use computers for that. Arguably, you don't need to learn binomial multiplication at all, just use a computer which has been programmed by someone who has already bothered creating a calculator to solve the problem.

but the main reason why we learn so many things in maths is because they help you figure out how to approach a problem. and if you force this subject upon society to learn in every school, there are certainly going to be more people who atleast try.

by memorising maths, for example memorising most possible case of polynomial operation, or memorising integral rules, have you really fulfilled the goal of learning math? have you got better at thinking? applying problems to real life? No, you haven't.

 Most serious exams like JEE Advanced test less of your calculation speed and more of your conceptual understanding in calculations. And that's for a good reason. We want people who can work on logic, not people who memorise things, because with computers, that's becoming less useful.

LANGUAGE: is language really that complicated? It's inconsistent, and you may define that as complicated. Or some would just call it unpredictable

Some people make spelling reforms, grammar reforms, or completely new languages (constructed languages, aka conlangs). But these don't receive much attention because most people don't want to bother

So if most people think that, instead of forcing themselves and others to learn these hyperefficient conlangs, they can just converse in their current languages, then it probably means that most people don't value language being simple.

And you don't have to switch to a different language to do that, either. For example, the English I used at the beginning of this message was quite simple, and badly formed, and I'm not even using conjunctions properly. Yet I don't find it difficult to converse in English.

Language rules are not hard rules, they're mostly merely guidelines. Stray too far away and you'll be incomprehensible, which is why we learn grammar.

But it's not necessary.
10/26/22, 5:34 PM - Ryan: What about fragmentation?
10/26/22, 5:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: I am sorry Ryan

To accompany them in the other world?
10/27/22, 2:39 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: probably yeah

10/27/22, 4:38 PM - Ryan: Why not

10/27/22, 4:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: Time waste hoga
10/27/22, 4:41 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?
10/27/22, 4:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/27/22, 4:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: 99% means I have to do good in the language subjects aswell
10/27/22, 4:41 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/27/22, 4:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: And it involves learning some useless things too
10/27/22, 4:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: also I can't get 99% this year
10/27/22, 4:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: My percentage is too low
10/27/22, 4:42 PM - Amritansh: Same
10/27/22, 4:47 PM - Ryan: Does it matter

10/27/22, 4:48 PM - Ryan: Marks don't make you smart
10/27/22, 4:49 PM - Ryan: I severely lack GK

10/27/22, 4:51 PM - Ryan: Don't force yourself to be a topper
10/27/22, 4:51 PM - Ryan: Study what you want
10/27/22, 4:51 PM - Ryan: Mainly resources

And industries

I think Agriculture was the unique one
10/27/22, 4:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yea
10/27/22, 4:52 PM - Ryan: But you will have to be prepared to disappoint some people
10/27/22, 4:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: prepared to dissapoint
10/27/22, 4:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes im preparing to commit mass atrocities
10/27/22, 4:52 PM - Ryan: For that you need some mental strength

10/27/22, 4:53 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: LMAO WHAT
10/27/22, 4:54 PM - Ryan: Only then he can study what he wants

Choose to study what he wants I think
10/27/22, 4:54 PM - Ryan: It is not like everyone can be good in each subject
10/27/22, 4:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: this sounds so passive-aggressive lmao
10/27/22, 4:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: but is he
10/27/22, 4:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: is he ready

10/27/22, 4:56 PM - Ryan: The person he disappoints

His/Her entire view about amritansh can change

Disappointing someone is sad

But what if it is for the greater good?
10/27/22, 4:56 PM - Amritansh: No
10/27/22, 4:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: The greater good is more important but most people don't immediately think like that
10/27/22, 4:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: We are conditioned to strive for our pleasure
10/27/22, 4:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: Are we really us?
10/27/22, 4:57 PM - Amritansh: Its my mom
10/27/22, 4:57 PM - Ryan: No
10/27/22, 4:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: It's like having a conversation
10/27/22, 4:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: I have every reason to go do 30 push ups right now
10/27/22, 4:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: But for some reason I am not doing it

You have to talk with yourself
10/27/22, 4:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: We don't know us well
10/27/22, 4:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: We pretend we do
10/27/22, 4:58 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/27/22, 4:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: Criteria for failure

When have we messed up?

When are we not fulfilling our responsibilities?
10/27/22, 4:59 PM - Ryan: Most of us I believe are animal-like

We are just animals with morals I think

Morals to which we are not loyal

We constantly change our opinions
10/27/22, 5:00 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: woof
10/27/22, 5:00 PM - Ryan: You might have already failed yourself
10/27/22, 5:00 PM - Amritansh: No
10/27/22, 5:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/27/22, 5:00 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: @917838968821 wake up to reality

10/27/22, 5:03 PM - Amritansh: @917838968821
10/27/22, 5:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: I've set a criteria for failure several times

Failed every single one

People overestimate themselves much more than they like to admit

Here, me using people further shows that I'm not ready to say that it's only me who sucks instead of many people

Being good at something temporarily does not mean you will always be great at it

How do we talk with ourselves honestly
10/27/22, 5:03 PM - Amritansh: 58‚ÑÖ subtitles are done
10/27/22, 5:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: We are too stimulated by our surroundings

10/27/22, 8:08 PM - Amritansh: No hate towards you
10/27/22, 8:08 PM - Amritansh: I would also ask questions to everyone or you too
10/27/22, 8:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: Relate to what?

10/27/22, 9:17 PM - Amritansh: <Media omitted>
10/27/22, 9:17 PM - Aditya Vardhan: call karo
10/27/22, 9:31 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 what is necrotizing fasciitis?

What is congenital  analgesia?

If I infect swamp water, E.Coli, some saliva, and milk in a body at the muscle tissue

What will happen?
10/27/22, 9:32 PM - Ryan: *inject I think
10/27/22, 9:33 PM - Ryan: What is fentanyl?
10/27/22, 9:35 PM - Ryan: Tissue necrosis will take place right?

But will it be due to the bacteria or because of the fluids?

I am stupid
10/27/22, 9:35 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: goofy ahh
10/27/22, 9:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: anesthesia
10/27/22, 9:36 PM - Ryan: Any other uses?
10/27/22, 9:36 PM - Ryan: What is this fentanyl abuse epidemic?

Why are people over-dosing on this
10/27/22, 9:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: what is necrotizing fasciitis

congenital analgesia is not being able to perceive pain

what? like you infect some muscle tissue using these things?
10/27/22, 9:36 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: can i inject in  muscle
10/27/22, 9:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: Because it's addictive
10/27/22, 9:36 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: steriod?
10/27/22, 9:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: Feels nice
10/27/22, 9:36 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/27/22, 9:36 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: steoid
10/27/22, 9:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: No pain feels nic
10/27/22, 9:36 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: steroid
10/27/22, 9:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: But then
10/27/22, 9:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: can i inject
10/27/22, 9:38 PM - Ryan: It's in powder form right?

Available in powder form? Sometimes made to look like pills? (For illegal purposes?)
10/27/22, 9:39 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ok can i inhale
10/27/22, 9:41 PM - Ryan: I think it is tissue necrosis due to bacteria

Muscle rots from the inside and it can transfer through wounds to even small cuts and insect bites I think

I think it is a group of bacteria that infects the tissue like Enterobacteraceae, Staphylococcus Aureus, Peptostreptococcus etc

Anaerobic bacteria produces gases which also contributes to tissue necrosis I think

It is pretty rare I think
10/27/22, 9:41 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ryan/anant can i inhae
10/27/22, 9:41 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: inject
10/27/22, 9:42 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: or drink
10/27/22, 9:42 PM - Ryan: I think I can be severely wrong

Confirm twice
10/27/22, 9:42 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: fentanyl
10/27/22, 9:42 PM - Ryan: Yes I think

2 gram dose is lethal
10/27/22, 9:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: Thanks
10/27/22, 9:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: Today I learned
10/27/22, 9:43 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: name 5 steroids, NOW
10/27/22, 9:43 PM - Ryan: I don't know
10/27/22, 9:43 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: @917838968821 @919717944490 name steroids please
10/27/22, 9:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't know man I'm not a drug dealer I'm a high-explosives dealer
10/27/22, 9:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: lamp oil, rope, bombs, you want it?
10/27/22, 9:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: it's yours my friend
10/27/22, 9:48 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: as long as you have enough rupiyas
10/27/22, 10:28 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 why do states exist?
10/27/22, 10:28 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: diversity im guessing?
10/27/22, 10:29 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: because many religions in india
10/27/22, 10:29 PM - Ryan: What are the advantages of having states in a country

Why can't it be just one undivided piece of land
10/27/22, 10:29 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ah yes not india in particular
10/27/22, 10:29 PM - Ryan: Is that really a reason?
10/27/22, 10:29 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: this seems like a controversial topic
10/27/22, 10:29 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: no that was from my last braincell
10/27/22, 10:30 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: let me regen
10/27/22, 10:30 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: brain aneurysm
10/27/22, 10:32 PM - Ryan: Easier governance?

Divide the country into states and make state governments to handle state affairs?
10/27/22, 10:33 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i dont know man
10/27/22, 10:33 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ask master anant
10/27/22, 10:33 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: wisdom he shall giveth
10/27/22, 10:33 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: is knowledge collected from schools considered to be wisdom?
10/27/22, 10:33 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: gained*
10/27/22, 10:33 PM - Ryan: What is wisdom?
10/27/22, 10:33 PM - Ryan: @917838968821
10/27/22, 10:34 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: experience or understanding
10/27/22, 10:34 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
10/27/22, 10:34 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: what do you think
10/27/22, 10:34 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: do you have other opinions?
10/27/22, 10:34 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: do you think im wrong? i dont want an "i am stupid idk" message
10/27/22, 10:34 PM - Ryan: We experience a lot of things right

Does that necessarily increase wisdom?
10/27/22, 10:35 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: does that include maturity too then?
10/27/22, 10:35 PM - Ryan: What is maturity?
10/27/22, 10:35 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: maturity and wisdom, what's the difference
10/27/22, 10:35 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i want you to answer now
10/27/22, 10:35 PM - Ryan: And intelligent persons have a better understanding as well right?

What is the difference between intelligent and wise?
10/27/22, 10:36 PM - Aditya Vardhan: banan steroids
10/27/22, 10:36 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: intelligent can be many ways
being wise can be being informed about a particular matter
10/27/22, 10:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: @919717944490 sometimes I don't know if you
10/27/22, 10:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: let me complete lmao, galti se enter dabgaya
10/27/22, 10:37 PM - Aditya Vardhan: This message was deleted
10/27/22, 10:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i dont know if you're self criticizing or if its just high level of sarcasm that i dont understand
10/27/22, 10:38 PM - Aditya Vardhan: no
10/27/22, 10:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: @919454835401 lmao bhai
10/27/22, 10:38 PM - Ryan: I don't know I am stupid

But seems complex

Maturity is proportional to rational thinking I think

Maturity I think is when someone thinks more rationally, isn't quick to make decisions and has less biases
10/27/22, 10:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i told you not to write "im stupid"
10/27/22, 10:38 PM - Ryan: What
10/27/22, 10:38 PM - Aditya Vardhan: ai is developing
10/27/22, 10:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: true
10/27/22, 10:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: you don't understand?
10/27/22, 10:39 PM - Ryan: I don't know
10/27/22, 10:39 PM - Aditya Vardhan: _classic_
10/27/22, 10:39 PM - Ryan: Aren't we all self-criticizing
10/27/22, 10:39 PM - Ryan: ?
10/27/22, 10:40 PM - Aditya Vardhan: no
10/27/22, 10:40 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?
10/27/22, 10:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: why do you write "im stupid" or "i dont know ask anant"
why not think about it yourself
why not use your own brain

im not telling you to stop being curious because thats a different topic
10/27/22, 10:40 PM - Aditya Vardhan: yes i am sure
10/27/22, 10:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: thats called being weak, holding yourself back
10/27/22, 10:40 PM - Ryan: I don't know
10/27/22, 10:40 PM - Aditya Vardhan: he dosent know
10/27/22, 10:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: üòê
10/27/22, 10:41 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: maybe it is sarcasm afterall
10/27/22, 10:41 PM - Ryan: Are you sure

Doesn't it just mean criticizing yourself

Where is the weak part

Am I holding myself back?
10/27/22, 10:41 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?
10/27/22, 10:41 PM - Ryan: I think the problem is that I don't have a brain
10/27/22, 10:41 PM - Aditya Vardhan: you do have a brain
10/27/22, 10:41 PM - Ryan: I am a little idiotic I think
10/27/22, 10:41 PM - Aditya Vardhan: you just think youre stupid
10/27/22, 10:41 PM - Aditya Vardhan: but you are not
10/27/22, 10:41 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: people criticize themselves because they're either too lazy or they're not ready to push their limits
10/27/22, 10:42 PM - Aditya Vardhan: you know that you are not
10/27/22, 10:42 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: im not sure ryan, you wont answer me
10/27/22, 10:42 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i dont even
10/27/22, 10:42 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ok bud
10/27/22, 10:42 PM - Aditya Vardhan: bud
10/27/22, 10:43 PM - Aditya Vardhan: plant wali bud
10/27/22, 10:43 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: lol
10/27/22, 10:43 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?

Or maybe too insecure? Maybe being too cautious? Can't it be because of your environment?

Are you sure?
10/27/22, 10:43 PM - Aditya Vardhan: nobody is sure
10/27/22, 10:43 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?
10/27/22, 10:43 PM - Aditya Vardhan: except ofc
10/27/22, 10:43 PM - Aditya Vardhan: yes i am sure
10/27/22, 10:43 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: 1. stop
2.  yes insecurity too and other things you mentioned i just gave examples. I did not list
3. stop
10/27/22, 10:44 PM - Ryan: hmm
10/27/22, 10:44 PM - Ryan: üòÄ
10/27/22, 10:44 PM - Aditya Vardhan: yes i am sure thaat nobody is sure execpt ofc
10/27/22, 10:44 PM - Aditya Vardhan: we were born cool
10/27/22, 10:44 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ooga booga
10/27/22, 10:44 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i was born near a nuclear reactor
10/27/22, 10:44 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: hit on the head with a metal rod as a child
10/27/22, 10:44 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: cant read stuff
10/27/22, 10:44 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: but boy can i play basketball
10/27/22, 10:44 PM - Aditya Vardhan: judges do be cryin
10/27/22, 10:45 PM - Aditya Vardhan: no you cant
10/27/22, 10:45 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i cant play basketball this was a meme normies
10/27/22, 10:45 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: This message was deleted
10/27/22, 10:45 PM - Ryan: I still can't understand why states exist?
10/27/22, 10:45 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: why not unblock anant and dm
10/27/22, 10:45 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: im not telling you to but why not do
10/27/22, 10:45 PM - Ryan: I can't
10/27/22, 10:45 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: okay i wont ask further
10/27/22, 10:47 PM - Aditya Vardhan: one cant control a whole country
10/27/22, 10:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: Why do cities exist?
10/27/22, 10:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: Because it makes administration more easier
10/27/22, 10:48 PM - Ryan: Why?
10/27/22, 10:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: .
10/27/22, 10:48 PM - Ryan: Only that?
10/27/22, 10:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: It differentiates different places

Most cities may be connected from rural areas
10/27/22, 10:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: But administration is the most major one
10/27/22, 10:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: And administration is easier when your people speak the same language and live in the same conditions
10/27/22, 10:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: That's why we have so many levels in India
10/27/22, 10:49 PM - Aditya Vardhan: so i was right
10/27/22, 10:49 PM - Ryan: Same conditions?
10/27/22, 10:49 PM - Aditya Vardhan: ONGA BONGA
10/27/22, 10:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: What is the advantage of being single, undivided?
10/27/22, 10:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: The states don't have much autonomy
10/27/22, 10:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: They just have rights to pass their own laws and stuff
10/27/22, 10:50 PM - Aditya Vardhan: unity
10/27/22, 10:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes, but in India the states are not that powerful
10/27/22, 10:50 PM - Dev: Hello
10/27/22, 10:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: For this slight purpose of unity, will you make administration more difficult?
10/27/22, 10:51 PM - Dev: The programing app?
10/27/22, 10:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: It might make people more divided
10/27/22, 10:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: Game engine hai
10/27/22, 10:51 PM - Dev: Chup
10/27/22, 10:51 PM - Aditya Vardhan: anant what was that unexpected number ehich was divisible by 17
10/27/22, 10:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: Because the government may not be able to focus on anything
10/27/22, 10:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: Mat karo
10/27/22, 10:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: 10^8 + 1
10/27/22, 10:51 PM - Aditya Vardhan: 100000001
10/27/22, 10:52 PM - Dev: 17√∑2=8.5
10/27/22, 10:52 PM - Aditya Vardhan: cool
10/27/22, 10:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: It's not divisible lol
10/27/22, 10:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: Definition for a | b is if (a / b) is in integers set
10/27/22, 10:52 PM - Aditya Vardhan: 18 is divisible by 17
10/27/22, 10:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: Being able to make decisions properly
10/27/22, 10:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
10/27/22, 10:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: The word is weird
10/27/22, 10:53 PM - Aditya Vardhan: 1.05882352941
10/27/22, 10:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: Depends if you use it to figure out how to make better decisions or not
10/27/22, 10:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: Kind of the opposite
10/27/22, 10:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: Intelligence isn't well defined
10/27/22, 10:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: But wisdom is being able to make useful inferences sometimes with less knowledge
10/27/22, 10:54 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?
10/27/22, 10:55 PM - Aditya Vardhan: 16*2+17*3+18*4
10/27/22, 10:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: AI is developing but Sentient AI isn't even close
10/27/22, 10:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
10/27/22, 10:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: 100% of the time I am not sure
10/27/22, 10:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: What's the point of asking it
10/27/22, 10:55 PM - Aditya Vardhan: i am sure that nothing said can be sure
10/27/22, 10:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: We can't be sure
10/27/22, 10:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/27/22, 10:55 PM - Aditya Vardhan: so you are sure that you are not sure
10/27/22, 10:56 PM - Ryan: So he can be sure
10/27/22, 10:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: Criticism isn't usually good on it's own, constructive criticism is important
10/27/22, 10:56 PM - Aditya Vardhan: what happened
10/27/22, 10:56 PM - Aditya Vardhan: oh no
10/27/22, 10:56 PM - Aditya Vardhan: anant is sure that he is not sure
10/27/22, 10:56 PM - Aditya Vardhan: why is this so confusing
10/27/22, 10:57 PM - Aditya Vardhan: so its not 100 percent anymore
10/27/22, 10:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: Words don't have to be definite
10/27/22, 10:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: In my opinion, atleast
10/27/22, 10:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: We say the word sure just like we use any other word
10/27/22, 10:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: To be useful
10/27/22, 10:58 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?
10/27/22, 10:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: I already answered your question
10/27/22, 10:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: What if I prepend to each of my messages "I'm not sure, but -"
10/27/22, 10:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: Like why not automatically assume it at this point
10/27/22, 10:59 PM - Aditya Vardhan: assuming can be bad
10/27/22, 10:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: If I say "yes, im sure", I am personally saying it as in "i am sure for most useful contexts"
10/27/22, 10:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: It can
10/27/22, 10:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: But continuously asking if someone is sure may not be better
10/27/22, 10:59 PM - Aditya Vardhan: kal school he
10/27/22, 10:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: If you read my message just prepend mentally "I am not sure, but <rest of msg>"
10/27/22, 10:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: Not for me üòé
10/27/22, 10:59 PM - Ryan: Yes
10/27/22, 10:59 PM - Ryan: And exams are near

I am failing
10/27/22, 11:00 PM - Aditya Vardhan: If you read my message just prepend mentally "I am not sure, but <rest of msg>"
10/27/22, 11:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes okay
10/27/22, 11:07 PM - Aditya Vardhan: .
10/27/22, 11:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: lmao

10/28/22, 4:00 PM - Ryan: I am confused with that
10/28/22, 4:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: So the probabilities are low
10/28/22, 4:00 PM - Ryan: And another SSC class missed today

10/28/22, 5:21 PM - Ryan: Ok
10/28/22, 5:21 PM - Ryan: But I am not sure if we have done enough questions

10/28/22, 10:54 PM - Navya: And I was like : WHAT? THEY DO CANDLE LIGHT DINNER FOR JUSTICE???
10/28/22, 11:15 PM - Ryan: <Media omitted>
10/28/22, 11:16 PM - Ryan: Or would I have to cut it and rewrite it?
10/28/22, 11:17 PM - Dev: This message was deleted
10/28/22, 11:17 PM - Dev: Seems right
10/28/22, 11:17 PM - Ryan: I don't know

Tanmay has a different answer
10/28/22, 11:17 PM - Ryan: Can their be two different answers in the book?
10/28/22, 11:17 PM - Dev: I mean did you write it from book?
10/28/22, 11:18 PM - Ryan: Probably no

Some part of it I think
10/28/22, 11:18 PM - Dev: I mean it is right
10/28/22, 11:18 PM - Dev: Everyone can't have the same answer
10/28/22, 11:19 PM - Ryan: What are the chances of scolding?
10/28/22, 11:19 PM - Dev: 0%
10/28/22, 11:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: Wasn't Q8 about controversial laws
10/28/22, 11:20 PM - Dev: Order ka farak nhai padta
10/28/22, 11:20 PM - Ryan: And I think domestic violence is a little bit incomplete

And I don't know why the controversial law regarding banning of hawking and street vending is used

Is it necessary?

It can surely be used as an example
10/28/22, 11:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/28/22, 11:23 PM - Ryan: But is the answer right?
10/28/22, 11:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: vvyv

10/29/22, 1:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: Hi Ryan
10/29/22, 1:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: <Media omitted>
10/29/22, 1:48 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 was the SC and ST reservation in private colleges (maybe article 15(5) 93rd amendment, i don't know i am stupid) a controversial law?
10/29/22, 1:48 PM - Ryan: üëã
10/29/22, 1:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes, a lot of reservation laws have been controversial
10/29/22, 1:48 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: interesting
10/29/22, 1:48 PM - Ryan: Nice
10/29/22, 1:50 PM - Ryan: And the points regarding the example of a controversial law in question "write a note on controversial laws"

Were they really necessary?

I think "for example" needs to be mentioned I think
10/29/22, 1:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: send your points again
10/29/22, 1:51 PM - Ryan: <Media omitted>
10/29/22, 1:52 PM - Ryan: Since municipal laws

Are these points necessary?
10/29/22, 1:52 PM - Ryan: I think it can be used for a question like "how is making street vending and hawking illegal a controversial law"
10/29/22, 1:53 PM - Ryan: I think the last two points are important
10/29/22, 1:53 PM - Ryan: And I think that the 2 points above the last two points can be used as an example
10/29/22, 3:02 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 there are venomous sharks?
10/29/22, 3:11 PM - Dev: <Media omitted>

DPS, GBN
10/29/22, 6:51 PM - Dev: So like 2pm pe hi dispersal hoga?
10/29/22, 8:01 PM - Ryan: Shorter zero periods?
10/29/22, 8:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: perhaps yes
10/29/22, 8:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: also @919717944490
10/29/22, 8:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: I took some products with some alcohol content in a plastic cap

heated it up

then i put in syringe, pulled some air, plugged the syringe really tightly with soap and applied vaseline on the plunger

then i pushed it and bit of smoke come out and noise
10/29/22, 8:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: Was it combustion?
10/29/22, 8:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: And how dangerous is it
10/29/22, 8:13 PM - Dev: I think
10/29/22, 8:22 PM - Amritansh 2: Departure
10/29/22, 8:22 PM - Amritansh 2: (Arrival from VMC)
10/29/22, 8:22 PM - Ryan: What did you just do?

Why did you do that?

How were you able to do that without getting your parents noticed?
10/29/22, 8:22 PM - Ryan: Gas and noise?

Explosion probably
10/29/22, 8:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: Made me flinch.
10/29/22, 8:23 PM - Amritansh: Guys chi chi
10/29/22, 8:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: I think the forced compression increased the temperature, causing something to potentially ignite? Alcohol in the products is very low concentration, but I definitely saw some smoke.

Why did I do that? Well...
10/29/22, 8:24 PM - Amritansh: Winter uniform bruh
10/29/22, 8:24 PM - Ryan: What ignited?
10/29/22, 8:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: Can alcohol not do that?
10/29/22, 8:25 PM - Ryan: What was that smoke?
10/29/22, 8:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: It can but the variety we can buy is of very low concentration. And the ones used in alcohol products, even less
10/29/22, 8:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: I have no idea
10/29/22, 8:25 PM - Ryan: I don't know

Probably
10/29/22, 8:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: It was mildly dark
10/29/22, 8:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: They are fuels
10/29/22, 8:26 PM - Ryan: Pretty bad ones right?
10/29/22, 8:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: Which is what made me think that
10/29/22, 8:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: Depends
10/29/22, 8:26 PM - Ryan: And also I heard they could be used in molotovs right?
10/29/22, 8:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: Specific Impulse? Energy density?
10/29/22, 8:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/29/22, 8:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: Alcohols have been used in rockets üëç
10/29/22, 8:27 PM - Ryan: Ok
10/29/22, 8:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: I'll try to recreate the experiment with higher concentrations
10/29/22, 8:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: Flamethrower?
10/29/22, 8:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: Or a gun?
10/29/22, 8:27 PM - Ryan: Try not dying?

And not accidentally inhaling the smoke
10/29/22, 8:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: The soap plug shoot out fast
10/29/22, 8:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: Will keep that in mind
10/29/22, 8:28 PM - Ryan: Hmm

Gun?
10/29/22, 8:28 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: hello people
10/29/22, 8:29 PM - Ryan: Will definitely try
10/29/22, 8:32 PM - Ryan: What alcohol did you use?
10/29/22, 8:32 PM - Ryan: @917838968821
10/29/22, 8:33 PM - Ryan: Did the alcohol react with the air to produce those gases?
10/29/22, 8:34 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: why is the depiction of aliens like this? üëΩ
10/29/22, 8:34 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: do they really exist
10/29/22, 8:34 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: has someone actually seen them
10/29/22, 8:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/29/22, 8:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: I saw you and proclaimed my discovery to the world
10/29/22, 8:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: Perhaps yes
10/29/22, 8:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ethanol
10/29/22, 8:37 PM - Ryan: Self made?
10/29/22, 8:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: Extraction from products described above
10/29/22, 8:39 PM - Ryan: Extracted?
10/29/22, 8:39 PM - Ryan: How
10/29/22, 9:46 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: underriodiodiroriodioo
10/29/22, 11:42 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 there is/was (I don't know) a ministry for yoga and Ayurveda?
10/29/22, 11:44 PM - Navya: he is not replying
10/29/22, 11:44 PM - Navya: he is prolly studying or sleeping
10/30/22, 12:00 AM - Dev: This message was deleted
10/30/22, 12:00 AM - Anant Tiwari: why not ministry of pharmaceuticals + meditation + fitness
10/30/22, 12:00 AM - Dev: Or shall I?
10/30/22, 12:00 AM - Dev: <Media omitted>
10/30/22, 12:28 AM - Dev: Anant
10/30/22, 12:28 AM - Dev: Shut up
10/30/22, 10:05 AM - Amritansh 2: Lol
10/30/22, 10:20 AM - Ryan: @917838968821 will the same general awareness be coming in the AI/Coding PA
10/30/22, 10:42 AM - Ryan: And what are the timings for the exam?

The same zero period?
10/30/22, 11:46 AM - Anant Tiwari: I don't know
10/30/22, 11:46 AM - Anant Tiwari: Most probably yes
10/30/22, 11:48 AM - Ryan: Hmm but the zero period is shorter now

When is the exam supposed to start
10/30/22, 11:49 AM - Dev: I think the exam will be of 30 mins
10/30/22, 11:49 AM - Amritansh: Yee
10/30/22, 11:50 AM - Ryan: But time will also be spent in distribution of the sheets, filling the details and signing
10/30/22, 11:50 AM - Dev: I donno
The timings also might change
10/30/22, 12:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: Only by 20 mins
10/30/22, 12:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: 50 mins still left
10/30/22, 12:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: 10 minutes for getting everything set up, 30 for exam, 10 for collecting and bangdu bingdu
10/30/22, 12:02 PM - Ryan: Hmm are you sure?
10/30/22, 12:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: @919717944490
10/30/22, 12:03 PM - Ryan: Yes I remember

But in this case, you can be sure right?

Or can you?
10/30/22, 12:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: Non
10/30/22, 12:04 PM - Ryan: And what are the advantages of getting good marks
10/30/22, 12:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: Non(e)
10/30/22, 12:04 PM - Ryan: I am failing in PA-3
10/30/22, 12:05 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: copy pasting lmao
10/30/22, 12:05 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yes you're failing PA-3, give up on your dreams
10/30/22, 12:05 PM - Ryan: Ok
10/30/22, 12:05 PM - Ryan: ü•≤
10/30/22, 12:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: bangdu
10/30/22, 12:05 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: bingdu
10/30/22, 12:05 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: free independence
10/30/22, 12:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: GUYSYOJ WONG BELIRVE GHIS
10/30/22, 12:06 PM - Ryan: And you will get full marks in ssc

@919999373163
10/30/22, 12:06 PM - Ryan: Right?
10/30/22, 12:06 PM - Ryan: You promised
10/30/22, 12:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: <Media omitted>
10/30/22, 12:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: ü§îü§®‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è
10/30/22, 12:08 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: no mein jaan booch ke fail hojaaunga maze maze mein
10/30/22, 12:09 PM - Ryan: But you will get scolded then?

And you promised
10/30/22, 12:10 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: arre brother
10/30/22, 12:10 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: mazaak
10/30/22, 12:10 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: observe
10/30/22, 12:10 PM - Ryan: üòÄ
10/30/22, 12:13 PM - Dev: Hmm

SCAM 2022üòé
10/30/22, 12:16 PM - Ryan: @919818027773 @919999373163 @917838968821 do you want jobs?
10/30/22, 12:18 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: not a corporate or a govmint one
10/30/22, 12:18 PM - Ryan: But why job?
10/30/22, 12:20 PM - Ryan: For money?
10/30/22, 12:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: I want money so I can not die and for that I want a job
10/30/22, 12:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: And not dying is fun
10/30/22, 12:22 PM - Ryan: You can get money through other means too

Probably a lot of money if you are successful
10/30/22, 12:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: But will these other means promote the greater good?
10/30/22, 12:23 PM - Ryan: Why greater good?
10/30/22, 12:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: I get some level of happiness from it
10/30/22, 12:23 PM - Ryan: Self-satisfaction is more important right
10/30/22, 12:23 PM - Ryan: Why?
10/30/22, 12:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't know
10/30/22, 12:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: It seems good
10/30/22, 12:24 PM - Ryan: Why worry about others

What will you gain accept happiness

Happiness is not necessary
10/30/22, 12:24 PM - Ryan: Right?
10/30/22, 12:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: For me happiness is one of things I want to strive for
10/30/22, 12:24 PM - Ryan: Why?
10/30/22, 12:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: If some level of working for the greater good brings me happiness, I'll do it
10/30/22, 12:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't know
10/30/22, 12:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: Happiness feels nice
10/30/22, 12:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: Not being happy feels not nice
10/30/22, 12:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: From my experience
10/30/22, 12:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: This fact may not change in the near future
10/30/22, 12:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: Hence why I like to be happy
10/30/22, 12:25 PM - Ryan: But isn't it useless

You can be happy from a lot of other things

Like money, power ,respect?
10/30/22, 12:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: Idk, those three don't inherently, immediately make me happy

What will respect do for us
Some people may get happy from respect
So it will be good for them
10/30/22, 12:27 PM - Ryan: This claim is kind of useless I think

Adulthood is sad, you will be selfish

You will be forced to become selfish

Right?
10/30/22, 12:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
10/30/22, 12:27 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?
10/30/22, 12:27 PM - Ryan: You will change certainly I believe
10/30/22, 12:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: From my observations of adults, yes
10/30/22, 12:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: Some people are truly happy
10/30/22, 12:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: Some are miserable
10/30/22, 12:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: Some people work for big corporate and lack free time
10/30/22, 12:28 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?
10/30/22, 12:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: What does this question mean
10/30/22, 12:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: Isnt it meaningless
10/30/22, 12:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: Why ask it
10/30/22, 12:28 PM - Ryan: I don't know
10/30/22, 12:28 PM - Ryan: But you can never be sure right?
10/30/22, 12:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: I'm pretty happy right now, compared to 1 month ago or 1 week ago
10/30/22, 12:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: I have made a guess that more money will somewhat help me be happy
10/30/22, 12:29 PM - Ryan: Probably

But will you continue being happy

It takes just one tragic event

And you will change completely
10/30/22, 12:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: Someone can have a heart attack right now and we will probably struggle to pay for the treatment because they are stupidly expensive.
10/30/22, 12:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: So the stress of someone suffering + stress of paying bills
10/30/22, 12:30 PM - Ryan: Worrying about others is never good for business right?

Or is it?
10/30/22, 12:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: If I had the money, there would only be the stress of someone suffering
10/30/22, 12:30 PM - Ryan: Morals are pretty useless in real life right?
10/30/22, 12:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: I assume if I had more money, I could leave my job earlier
10/30/22, 12:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes everything is useless
10/30/22, 12:31 PM - Dev: Stonks
10/30/22, 12:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: You can kill someone and it won't matter
10/30/22, 12:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: But some people don't because they want to have fun
10/30/22, 12:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: Infact most people don't bother
10/30/22, 12:31 PM - Ryan: Or will it?
10/30/22, 12:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: You said "Morals are pretty useless in real life right?"
10/30/22, 12:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: I am using that sentence to make my claim
10/30/22, 12:31 PM - Ryan: Killing someone without any gain is pretty useless
10/30/22, 12:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/30/22, 12:32 PM - Ryan: You will probably be arrested if you aren't careful enough
10/30/22, 12:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: Why not die before that
10/30/22, 12:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: Some people claim life is meaningless
10/30/22, 12:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: And yes it is
10/30/22, 12:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: Life is suffering
10/30/22, 12:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: But there's some fun in it
10/30/22, 12:32 PM - Ryan: Probably can kill rival competitors and journalists for the gain
10/30/22, 12:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: If you do better there is more fun in it
10/30/22, 12:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: That's why people stay alive
10/30/22, 12:32 PM - Ryan: Preserving your image is very important for business right?
10/30/22, 12:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/30/22, 12:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: So are you happy with my answers of why I want a job?
10/30/22, 12:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: Morals are pretty useful if you don't want to die
10/30/22, 12:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: If you want to be happy
10/30/22, 12:33 PM - Dev: Stonks can make millions a month
10/30/22, 12:33 PM - Ryan: Life is a game right?

You can interfere in other's lives

There will be losers and winners

And only the winners will celebrate right?
10/30/22, 12:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: If you don't want to be happy, if nothing matters then morals don't matter either
10/30/22, 12:33 PM - Dev: If you are smort enough
10/30/22, 12:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: Losers celebrate too
10/30/22, 12:34 PM - Ryan: I don't think so
10/30/22, 12:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: Why?
10/30/22, 12:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: Give an example of a moral
10/30/22, 12:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: Looking after others?
10/30/22, 12:34 PM - Ryan: They prevent you from thinking about yourself
10/30/22, 12:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: No they don't
10/30/22, 12:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: A person just chooses to prevent themselves from doing something and then blames it on some part of society
10/30/22, 12:35 PM - Ryan: People with morals often can't make decisions that will severely harm others but benefit themselves probably
10/30/22, 12:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: That's good, right?
10/30/22, 12:35 PM - Ryan: The person?

Or maybe the law?
10/30/22, 12:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: They will have satisfaction from not harming others
10/30/22, 12:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: What?
10/30/22, 12:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: The law is not related to this
10/30/22, 12:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: I am talking in the context of morals
10/30/22, 12:35 PM - Amritansh: Guys
10/30/22, 12:35 PM - Amritansh: Did anyone see my video
10/30/22, 12:35 PM - Amritansh: üìπ To
10/30/22, 12:36 PM - Amritansh: New one
10/30/22, 12:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: Harming people in a way that it doesn't breach laws but is still bad, what defines it being bad? Morals
10/30/22, 12:36 PM - Ryan: The law plays an important role in people's decisions right

It also kind of has established morals right?
10/30/22, 12:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: And harming people does not make me happy
10/30/22, 12:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: Laws are established morals... yes, I'd agree
10/30/22, 12:36 PM - Amritansh: Same lmao
10/30/22, 12:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: So morals are non-established morals in that context
10/30/22, 12:36 PM - Ryan: Murder is bad?

Torture is bad?

Human experiment is bad?

Why? Pain?
10/30/22, 12:36 PM - Amritansh: üáºüá∏ Samoa
10/30/22, 12:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: They don't make me happy and thus they are bad for me

They would be more likely to make me happy if I did not have morals
10/30/22, 12:37 PM - Amritansh: null
10/30/22, 12:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: I do have some levels of morals
10/30/22, 12:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: Bhai mass ping mat karo
10/30/22, 12:37 PM - Amritansh: Same
10/30/22, 12:37 PM - Ryan: What if it did made you happy?

Would it be good then
10/30/22, 12:37 PM - Amritansh: Oka
10/30/22, 12:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: Good for me, yes
10/30/22, 12:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: That's why people do evil things
10/30/22, 12:37 PM - Amritansh: Anant
10/30/22, 12:37 PM - Amritansh: Answer
10/30/22, 12:37 PM - Ryan: The law kind of defines good and bad right now?
10/30/22, 12:37 PM - Amritansh: The question
10/30/22, 12:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: What?
10/30/22, 12:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: Not yet
10/30/22, 12:37 PM - Amritansh: .
10/30/22, 12:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: I did not use youtube much
10/30/22, 12:37 PM - Ryan: Sometimes they know it's bad but they don't care
10/30/22, 12:37 PM - Amritansh: Ohk
10/30/22, 12:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: Depends
10/30/22, 12:38 PM - Amritansh: Did not lmao
10/30/22, 12:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't care what the law says
10/30/22, 12:38 PM - Amritansh: Do not"
10/30/22, 12:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: It's correct
10/30/22, 12:38 PM - Dev: Dw
10/30/22, 12:38 PM - Dev: Da
10/30/22, 12:38 PM - Amritansh: Da
10/30/22, 12:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: Do not implies I don't use it for extended periods of time, as if it's my general condition
10/30/22, 12:38 PM - Ryan: I think you kind of do
10/30/22, 12:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: I just didn't use it much yesterday or today
10/30/22, 12:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: No I am saying from the perspective of
10/30/22, 12:38 PM - Dev: Use what?
10/30/22, 12:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: Someone who does not have morals
10/30/22, 12:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: Someone who does not care at all
10/30/22, 12:38 PM - Ryan: Oh ok
10/30/22, 12:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: Then what brings them happiness can be some vile, atrocious things
10/30/22, 12:39 PM - Dev: Ah
10/30/22, 12:39 PM - Amritansh: OK, kann mir jemand das Konzept des Balancierens in der Chemie erkl√§ren?
10/30/22, 12:39 PM - Dev: Reddit
10/30/22, 12:39 PM - Ryan: Sadism?
10/30/22, 12:39 PM - Dev: And Instagram full of memems
10/30/22, 12:39 PM - Amritansh: Memems
10/30/22, 12:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: I did not use it yesterday
10/30/22, 12:39 PM - Amritansh: Please helpüò£
10/30/22, 12:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: did not sahi hai grammatically in this context üò≠
10/30/22, 12:39 PM - Ryan: Unnecessarily inflicting harm on others just for happiness and pleasure is not profitable right?
10/30/22, 12:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't know what defines sadism
10/30/22, 12:39 PM - Amritansh: Explain balancing
10/30/22, 12:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: I cannot comment on it
10/30/22, 12:40 PM - Amritansh: Sadism lmao
10/30/22, 12:40 PM - Amritansh: Please
10/30/22, 12:40 PM - Ryan: It is just that morals shouldn't come in the way of profit and self-prosperity I think
10/30/22, 12:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: May not be profitable but these people may not care about that again, they may just want to be happy in whatever way possible

Without morals, there are many ways for achieving happiness without profit
10/30/22, 12:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: Okay, fair
10/30/22, 12:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: I just think that generally following morals makes me happy
Hence following them is part of self-prosperity
10/30/22, 12:41 PM - Ryan: You shouldn't care if people are exploited for the extraction of the resources you use if you get profit from it

Right?
10/30/22, 12:41 PM - Amritansh: GUYS
10/30/22, 12:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: I should care but I don't
10/30/22, 12:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: My phone is made unethically
10/30/22, 12:41 PM - Amritansh: EXPLAIN FRICKING BALANCING

10/30/22, 12:42 PM - Amritansh: Yes
10/30/22, 12:42 PM - Amritansh: How to do
10/30/22, 12:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: So LHS = RHS, conservation of mass
10/30/22, 12:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: Book me hai
10/30/22, 12:42 PM - Amritansh: What
10/30/22, 12:42 PM - Ryan: Change constants probably?

10/30/22, 4:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: How what?
10/30/22, 4:20 PM - Ryan: **How is AI**
10/30/22, 4:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: Many types of patterns can be found
Does the IP address of each transaction change?
The AI can see user agent in each request, and perhaps make a note of that if it's unusual
The AI can build a list of the types of content the transactions are being made on
10/30/22, 4:21 PM - Tanmaya: Yes parle g is OG

10/30/22, 4:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't know in those
10/30/22, 4:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: AI is not amazing at idea generation
10/30/22, 4:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: I mean GPT-3 Text is decent
10/30/22, 4:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: But not that you could make a movie out of it
10/30/22, 4:24 PM - Tanmaya: you have been sentenced in jail for eternity
10/30/22, 4:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: Storyboard? Ehhh
10/30/22, 4:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: NO
10/30/22, 4:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: And budgeting... AI is not used in any of these
10/30/22, 4:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: Or atleast I can't think how it would be used

10/30/22, 4:26 PM - Ryan: You are physically challenged?
10/30/22, 4:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: Stupid automated replies
10/30/22, 4:26 PM - Dev: üòÉ
10/30/22, 4:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/30/22, 4:26 PM - Dev: It's not better

10/30/22, 4:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: How do you differentiate it fron intelligent
10/30/22, 4:28 PM - Dev: This message was deleted
10/30/22, 4:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: More data processing? Or can it somehow problem solve better?
10/30/22, 4:29 PM - Dev: If someone asks a question that has not already been asked or there is a solution for ai is retarded

10/30/22, 4:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: I am sorry
10/30/22, 4:35 PM - Tanmaya: AI is good but now we are too depended on it like we can't survive which is bad
10/30/22, 4:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: i am bad at performance, i don't need AI to predict it

10/31/22, 4:30 PM - Dev: It's not
10/31/22, 4:30 PM - Ryan: Hmm
10/31/22, 4:31 PM - Ryan: What is user-friendly?
10/31/22, 4:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: Something easy to use
10/31/22, 4:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: Python is _comparatively_ user friendly

Compared to what?
10/31/22, 4:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: You deleted this message
10/31/22, 4:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: But then you give up some low-level control
10/31/22, 4:34 PM - Ryan: But that depends from person to person right?
10/31/22, 4:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: If you intend to do low-level programming, it won't be user friendly
10/31/22, 4:34 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: lmao
10/31/22, 4:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: Why don't you write a hello world program in x86 assembly and tell me which one is easier
10/31/22, 4:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: And explain each line of it's working
10/31/22, 4:35 PM - Ryan: I am too stupid for both
10/31/22, 4:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: Millions of people try and the data is that x86 assembly gives you too much control, does not have human readable instruction names, follows odd syntax
10/31/22, 4:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: So python is more user friendly than x86 in that regard
10/31/22, 4:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yet writing an operating system in python is pretty much impossible while you need to write some amount of assembly code to make an OS
10/31/22, 4:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: User friendly is only mildly meaningful

10/31/22, 6:15 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: 1/3 chodho we'll take x/3
10/31/22, 6:15 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: x/3 = 1/7 (184 -x)
10/31/22, 6:15 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: plus 8
10/31/22, 6:15 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: check karo
10/31/22, 6:16 PM - Ryan: Probably
10/31/22, 6:16 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: answer key is there?
10/31/22, 6:16 PM - Ryan: No I think
10/31/22, 6:16 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: okay
10/31/22, 6:19 PM - Ryan: The answer is coming 72 then?
10/31/22, 6:21 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i haven't solved buddy
10/31/22, 6:21 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: 72 +72 kya hota hai
10/31/22, 6:21 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: wait No
10/31/22, 6:21 PM - Ryan: And 112 maybe
10/31/22, 6:21 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ah yes
10/31/22, 6:21 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: 2 parts
10/31/22, 6:21 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: okay
10/31/22, 6:22 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: 112 + 72 is 184 then
10/31/22, 6:23 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: This message was deleted
10/31/22, 6:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: 1)
a) False, powers for x are 1/3 or 0
b) True
x) False, equation can be rearranged in quadratic form

2) z = 4z/5 + 8 =>
z - 8 = 4z / 5 =>
5z - 40 = 4z =>
-z = -40 => z = 40
root is 40

3) i think x/3 + x/7 + 8 = 184
=> (7x + 3x)/21 = 176
=> 10x = 176√ó21 = 3696
=> x = 3696/10
so first division would be x/3 = 123 + (1/5)
and second division = x/7 = 52 + (4/5)
10/31/22, 6:26 PM - Aditya Vardhan: This message was deleted
10/31/22, 6:26 PM - Ryan: Hmm
10/31/22, 6:37 PM - Ryan: How x/7
10/31/22, 6:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: 184 is split into two parts
We have been told through the word problem that one is greater than the other by some amount
The question uses "some amount" as the numerator for parts, so i let that be X
and then made equation around it = 184

then solve for x

but the actual parts are not x, they are terms of x (x/3, and x/7)
10/31/22, 6:42 PM - Ryan: And for question 4

The number of 5 Rupee notes and the number of 10 Rupee notes is 60 and 70 respectively right?
10/31/22, 6:43 PM - Ryan: And the answer for question 5 is 30 right?

@917838968821
10/31/22, 6:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
10/31/22, 6:44 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: how
10/31/22, 6:44 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: can you explain
10/31/22, 6:45 PM - Ryan: 2x=1/2x+45
2x-1/2x=45
4/2x-1/2x=45
3/2x=45
X=45√ó2/3=90/3=30
?
10/31/22, 6:46 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: okay thank you
10/31/22, 6:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: Okay first part is make an equation out of the sentence

find _a number_
we don't know that number so our goal is to find _x_

now the question tells us that x's double (that is, 2x) is 45 greater than it's half (x/2)

so 2x = x/2 + 45
now we can find value of x
2x = x/2 + 45 = (x + 90) / 2
2x = (x + 90) / 2
now we get rid of that / 2 on both sides, by transposing
2x * 2 = x + 90
4x = x + 90
now x ko transpose karo, so we have x's on one side of equation and simple number on the other side
4x = x + 90
4x - x = 90
3x = 90
x = 90 / 3 = 30
x = 30

11/1/22, 8:02 PM - Amritansh: Lmao
11/1/22, 8:03 PM - Amritansh: I don't know why isomers exist
11/1/22, 8:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: What do you want me to answer
11/1/22, 8:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: Because there are many ways in which atoms can bond
11/1/22, 8:03 PM - Amritansh: Hmm
11/1/22, 8:03 PM - Amritansh: What's the need
11/1/22, 8:03 PM - Amritansh: We can only use n_butanes
11/1/22, 8:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: Why can't we use other isomers? What do you mean? Use for what?
11/1/22, 8:05 PM - Ryan: What will be the answer to this

And how have we done it in the notebook

If we have, then I can't find the answer
11/1/22, 8:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: Book se check karlo, maybe some points of how it was enforced, opposition to it's enforcement etc
11/1/22, 8:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: I am not sure as I have not read the chapter
11/1/22, 8:06 PM - Ryan: At LMS it is said that the answer is there in the workbook

If I work to create an answer on my own then there are huge chances that I am wrong
11/1/22, 8:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: Then mam will correct it
11/1/22, 8:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: I'll find tomorrow
11/1/22, 8:07 PM - Ryan: *notebook
11/1/22, 8:11 PM - Dev: The answer should be
Who raised the point for this new law. There were protests , and when s law came in 2002 it was nothing dmae to the law they demanded, so they protested, and then in 2005 a bill was introduced and in 2006 it became a law
11/1/22, 8:12 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?
11/1/22, 8:13 PM - Dev: I think
11/1/22, 8:14 PM - Ryan: It makes sense to me

But I am stupid in terms of everything

11/1/22, 8:50 PM - Ryan: Is this answer right?

"The issue was raised by the women in society and their voice helped to get the need for a new law regarding this issue reach the parliament. A bill was introduced in the parliament in 2002 but the women weren't satisfied with the provisions. They opposed the bill and in December 2002, the Standing Commitee submitted its recommendations to the rajya sabha and these were also tabled in the lok sabha. The committee's report accepted most of the demands of the women's groups. Finally, a new bill was introduced in Parliament in 2005. After being passed in both the houses of parliament. It was sent to the president for his assent. The protection of women from domestic violence Act came into effect in 2006"

11/1/22, 11:39 PM - Dev: No
11/1/22, 11:39 PM - Dev: Barely any question discussed in class
11/1/22, 11:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: Why do they need to be
11/1/22, 11:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: Read the book, do research and frame answers
11/1/22, 11:40 PM - Dev: Why not?
11/1/22, 11:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: Most of the SSC questions don't directly come from book
11/1/22, 11:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: Because then you lose research skills and just mug up the answers
11/2/22, 3:01 PM - Aditya Vardhan: @917838968821 how do feel knowing

11/2/22, 7:01 PM - Amritansh: HD
11/2/22, 7:02 PM - Amritansh: Why do you have negative thoughts @919717944490
11/2/22, 7:02 PM - Amritansh: Also typing allowed for you now
11/2/22, 7:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: No, if he's so worried, he has to not spend time typing
11/2/22, 7:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: I disallow typing for him
11/2/22, 7:15 PM - Amritansh 2: Okay
11/2/22, 7:15 PM - Amritansh 2: Good thinking
11/2/22, 7:15 PM - Amritansh 2: But why does he have negative thoughts in his mind @917838968821
11/2/22, 7:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: idk man ask Ryan.
11/2/22, 8:06 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: sarcasm
11/2/22, 8:46 PM - Amritansh 2: Sarahuacasm
11/2/22, 9:04 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 can you create a maths test for me
11/2/22, 9:04 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ryan is typing
11/2/22, 9:04 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: can thog create too
11/2/22, 9:04 PM - Ryan: Yes
11/2/22, 9:05 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: wait nvm lets ask anant
11/2/22, 9:05 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i wanna solve too
11/2/22, 9:05 PM - Ryan: Are you sure

My Brain has gone dull after UT-2
11/2/22, 9:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: sure
11/2/22, 9:05 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ok buddy
11/2/22, 9:06 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: anant give 5 questions
11/2/22, 9:06 PM - Ryan: Should be enough for 10 marker
11/2/22, 9:07 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ye
11/2/22, 9:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: factor (x¬≤ - 4) = 0, using (a2 - b¬≤) = (a+b)(a-b) and find roots of each linear polynomial (don't use quadratic formula) (for ryan)

factor 9x¬≤ + 36x + 36 using (a+b)¬≤ = (a¬≤ + b¬≤ + 2ab), and find the value of x (for ryan)

2x/5(5 + 3/8) = 2, find x
7x + 5 = 2x + 9, find x
find the root of the function p(x) = 3x + 3 (for ryan)

ryan has 15u ducks CURRENTLY. 10 days ago, he had 30 ducks, and each day, he gets 2 ducks. find the value of u

find three consecutive of 8 which add to 256
11/2/22, 9:12 PM - Anant Tiwari: and the others @919999373163 o
11/2/22, 9:12 PM - Anant Tiwari: do
11/2/22, 9:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: also for second last question ignore the fractional duck, i don't know why there is 1/3rd of a duck
11/2/22, 9:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: my bad, for second polynomial assume 9x¬≤ + 36x + 36 = 0
11/2/22, 9:18 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: bhai last q mein value
11/2/22, 9:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: no
11/2/22, 9:20 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: can you recheck questions
11/2/22, 9:21 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: for me, like fraction mein aarah ahai answwer?
11/2/22, 9:21 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: for ducks waala
11/2/22, 9:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes, exactly, the last one can't be 256
11/2/22, 9:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes, that's supposed to happen
11/2/22, 9:21 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: you fucking idiot you wasted me time
11/2/22, 9:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: a duck got murdered
11/2/22, 9:21 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: Ok then 4/3
11/2/22, 9:21 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ig
11/2/22, 9:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: are you sure
11/2/22, 9:21 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: kill yourself
11/2/22, 9:21 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: pehle you give me wrong valu
11/2/22, 9:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: it is fun making bullshit maths questions
11/2/22, 9:21 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: im gonna blame it on you
11/2/22, 9:22 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: waaaaaaa
11/2/22, 9:22 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: buddy kya
11/2/22, 9:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: you did calculations wrong but a fractional duck exists in the answer, yes
11/2/22, 9:22 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: kyu
11/2/22, 9:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: the questions are solvable except for the last one
11/2/22, 9:22 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: kill yourselffff
11/2/22, 9:22 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: it wont be painfull
11/2/22, 9:22 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: is it 3/4 then?
11/2/22, 9:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: nope
11/2/22, 9:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: but it is fractional
11/2/22, 9:22 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ok
11/2/22, 9:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: hint your denominator is correct
11/2/22, 9:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: numerator isn't
11/2/22, 9:23 PM - Dev: 5/3
11/2/22, 9:23 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: 15 u
10 days ago = 30 u - 10

15u = 30u - 10
15u - 30 u = -10
-15 u = 10
u = -15/-10
3/2?
11/2/22, 9:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: times two
11/2/22, 9:24 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: im literlaly calculation on whatsapp lmao
11/2/22, 9:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: no
11/2/22, 9:24 PM - Dev: 10/3
11/2/22, 9:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: ok im writing solution
11/2/22, 9:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
11/2/22, 9:24 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: 10/3
11/2/22, 9:24 PM - Dev: üòÉ
11/2/22, 9:24 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: bohot pareshan kiya hai tune anant
11/2/22, 9:24 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ab mein kal
11/2/22, 9:24 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: bohot pareshan karunga
11/2/22, 9:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: 10 days ago he had 30 ducks
2 per day * 10 = 20
30 + 20 = 50 ducks now

but # ducks now given to be 15
15u = 50 = # ducks now
u = 50 / 15 = 10/3 + 3.333...
11/2/22, 9:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: accha
11/2/22, 9:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: last line 10/3 = 3.333...*
11/2/22, 9:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: last one is not possible even with fractional multiples
11/2/22, 9:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: ryan are you done buddy
11/2/22, 9:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: @919717944490
11/2/22, 9:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: <Media omitted>
11/2/22, 9:31 PM - Ryan: First one 2 I think

Did we have to use a¬≤-b¬≤=(a+b)(a-b)

x¬≤=4
Square root of x=square root of 4

x=2
Ok

Second one I used quadratic formula because I find it easier

But my answer is coming -2?

40/43?

4/5?

p=6?

x=1?

10/3?

How is this supposed to be done i don't know
11/2/22, 9:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: ANSWER KEY:
1) ¬±4
2) +2
3) 40/43
4) 2
5) -1
6) 10/3
7) not solvable
11/2/22, 9:31 PM - Ryan: Most of mine are probably wrong
11/2/22, 9:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: don't worry they are very close
11/2/22, 9:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: be careful of signs and transposition order
11/2/22, 9:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: 1) ¬±2 my bad
11/2/22, 9:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: for 1st one you could factor or use formula, both work
11/2/22, 9:35 PM - Ryan: And how is the value of x in fourth one 2?

7x+5=2x+9m
11/2/22, 9:35 PM - Ryan: -m

Remove that m
11/2/22, 9:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: subtract 2x both side
5x + 5 = 9
5x - 14 = 0
using x = -b/a standard solution for linear ax+c = 0, you get 14 / 5
and 14 / 5 ‚â† 2

so i am an idiot
11/2/22, 9:37 PM - Ryan: And in the question p(x)=3x+3

p is coming 6 and x is coming 1
11/2/22, 9:37 PM - Amritansh: Oh my god
11/2/22, 9:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: what?
11/2/22, 9:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: x = -1 here
11/2/22, 9:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: 3*-1 + 3 = 0
11/2/22, 9:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: and p ki value kese
what are you finding
11/2/22, 9:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: its the function name
11/2/22, 9:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: oh accha
11/2/22, 9:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: value of p(1)
11/2/22, 9:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: yeah thats 6
11/2/22, 9:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: but i asked to find root
11/2/22, 9:38 PM - Ryan: Root is the value that satisfies the equation right?
11/2/22, 9:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
11/2/22, 9:39 PM - Navya: Guys
11/2/22, 9:39 PM - Navya: Like
11/2/22, 9:39 PM - Navya: Wtf
11/2/22, 9:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: here in this form what x for RHS = 0
11/2/22, 9:39 PM - Navya: Maths ke book mai there is something else
11/2/22, 9:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: what?
11/2/22, 9:39 PM - Navya: and in workbook something else
11/2/22, 9:39 PM - Navya: and in revision shit something else
11/2/22, 9:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: uhh
11/2/22, 9:41 PM - Ryan: How is your answer coming 14/5?
11/2/22, 9:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: because i am trolling
11/2/22, 9:42 PM - Ryan: How many are correct

How many are wrong
11/2/22, 9:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: for this one its 5/4, last one is impossible and first one original answer i wrote was wrong
11/2/22, 9:43 PM - Ryan: 5/4?

Are you sure?
11/2/22, 9:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: nope!
11/2/22, 9:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: plug it in lmao
11/2/22, 9:44 PM - Ryan: What does that mean
11/2/22, 9:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: like x = 5/4 and then check if LHS = RHS
11/2/22, 9:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: here LHS‚â†RHS
11/2/22, 9:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: because x = 4 / 5
11/2/22, 9:44 PM - Ryan: Hmm ok
11/2/22, 9:46 PM - Ryan: I am failing the maths exam
11/2/22, 9:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: no because you got all answers correct
11/2/22, 9:47 PM - Ryan: üòÄ
11/2/22, 9:47 PM - Ryan: But the chances of me failing are still high

By what I consider failure
11/2/22, 9:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: accha ok different people have different definitions of failure
11/2/22, 9:48 PM - Ryan: Yes
11/2/22, 9:48 PM - Ryan: I am mostly as of now a failure
11/2/22, 9:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: according to your definition
11/2/22, 9:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: fair
11/2/22, 9:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ok
11/2/22, 9:49 PM - Ryan: And I don't know how students get over their marks so easily

Shouldn't they be depressed

Shouldn't this depression make them work harder?
11/2/22, 9:58 PM - Amritansh 2: Same bro
11/2/22, 10:01 PM - Aditya Vardhan: oh so you like math
11/2/22, 10:02 PM - Aditya Vardhan: name every positive integer

11/2/22, 10:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: Easy
11/2/22, 10:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: Done
11/2/22, 10:02 PM - Aditya Vardhan: but this is cheating
11/2/22, 10:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: i don't care
11/2/22, 10:03 PM - Aditya Vardhan: oh so you like maths
11/2/22, 10:03 PM - Aditya Vardhan: name every infinity
11/2/22, 10:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: aleph null
omega
true cardinality
uhhhh
11/2/22, 10:04 PM - Aditya Vardhan: uhhhh
11/2/22, 10:04 PM - Aditya Vardhan: new infinity found
11/2/22, 10:04 PM - Aditya Vardhan: uhhhh
11/2/22, 10:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: aleph null-n U (0, +inf)??
11/2/22, 10:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: nahi symbol galat
11/2/22, 10:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: i don't like maths
11/2/22, 10:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: i cannot name every infinity
11/2/22, 10:05 PM - Aditya Vardhan: noobde ho kya
11/2/22, 10:05 PM - Aditya Vardhan: let me make a new one
11/2/22, 10:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yay
11/2/22, 10:07 PM - Aditya Vardhan: just make a horizontally flipped 3 1000 times each one having a distance of 0.5 cm towards south east
11/2/22, 10:07 PM - Aditya Vardhan: you know what the biggest infinity is
11/2/22, 10:07 PM - Aditya Vardhan: its the absolute infinity
11/2/22, 10:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: but what is it
11/2/22, 10:08 PM - Aditya Vardhan: not a simple closed curve
11/2/22, 10:08 PM - Aditya Vardhan: seems like a zero with soremon legs
11/2/22, 10:08 PM - Aditya Vardhan: doremon
11/2/22, 10:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: what is it
11/2/22, 10:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: does it measure ordinals
11/2/22, 10:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: how is it different from omega
11/2/22, 10:09 PM - Aditya Vardhan: i am helping someone in maths
11/2/22, 10:09 PM - Aditya Vardhan: will be right back
11/2/22, 10:13 PM - Dev: Every odd number has a e in its name
11/2/22, 10:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: what about two
11/2/22, 10:19 PM - Aditya Vardhan: yes its just a coincidence
11/2/22, 10:20 PM - Aditya Vardhan: two is a odd number?
11/2/22, 10:20 PM - Aditya Vardhan: an*
11/2/22, 10:21 PM - Aditya Vardhan: because every odd number will contain 1 or 3 or 5 or 7 or 9
11/2/22, 10:21 PM - Aditya Vardhan: and all of these have e
11/2/22, 10:21 PM - Aditya Vardhan: so every odd no has e
11/2/22, 10:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: what about 12 bruh
11/2/22, 10:25 PM - Aditya Vardhan: what
11/2/22, 10:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: TW _E_ LV _E_
11/2/22, 10:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: and 12 has 2 so it's odd
11/2/22, 10:28 PM - Navya: jwa bwa 1234567 u make me feel like 11
11/2/22, 10:30 PM - Aditya Vardhan: what
11/2/22, 10:30 PM - Aditya Vardhan: how is twelve odd
11/2/22, 10:30 PM - Aditya Vardhan: read the sentence again
11/2/22, 10:30 PM - Aditya Vardhan: this sentence stater that every odd number has a e in it
11/2/22, 10:31 PM - Aditya Vardhan: it never said then an even number dont have e in it
11/2/22, 10:31 PM - Aditya Vardhan: so
11/2/22, 10:31 PM - Dev: Exactly
11/2/22, 10:31 PM - Dev: üòÉ
11/2/22, 10:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: when did i say that
11/2/22, 10:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: TWO DOES NOT HAVE AN E IN IT
11/2/22, 10:48 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 why do we think before speaking
11/2/22, 10:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: two is odd and it has an e
11/2/22, 10:53 PM - Aditya Vardhan: two is odd?
11/2/22, 10:53 PM - Aditya Vardhan: anant did you just confuse prime numbers with odd numbers
11/2/22, 10:54 PM - Ryan: And does alcohol affect our mind when it comes to thinking before speaking?

Can we interrogate someone using alcohol
11/2/22, 10:54 PM - Aditya Vardhan: @917838968821
11/2/22, 10:54 PM - Aditya Vardhan: bhau

11/2/22, 10:54 PM - Aditya Vardhan: i am a stack of inches high
11/2/22, 10:55 PM - Ryan: What if a person was unable to think before speaking

How early will he die? Or will he?
11/2/22, 10:55 PM - Ryan: @917838968821
11/2/22, 10:55 PM - Aditya Vardhan: Computer graphics today are the best they've ever been". They are always the best they've ever been.

11/2/22, 11:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: no??
11/2/22, 11:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: two is odd
11/2/22, 11:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: literally
11/2/22, 11:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: ill literally do in python and show
11/2/22, 11:04 PM - Aditya Vardhan: every number that is perfectly divisible by 2 is even
11/2/22, 11:04 PM - Aditya Vardhan: so 2 is even
11/2/22, 11:04 PM - Aditya Vardhan: simple
11/2/22, 11:04 PM - Aditya Vardhan: bhai
11/2/22, 11:04 PM - Aditya Vardhan: leave it
11/2/22, 11:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: ...

11/2/22, 11:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: <Media omitted>
11/2/22, 11:05 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: and 3 is even?
11/2/22, 11:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes

11/2/22, 11:06 PM - Aditya Vardhan: chotte bacche ho kya
11/2/22, 11:06 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: != ka matlab does not equal to hota hai
11/2/22, 11:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: <Media omitted>
11/2/22, 11:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes that's literally for odd
11/2/22, 11:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: if number is NOT divisible by 2
11/2/22, 11:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: then it is odd
11/2/22, 11:06 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: okay
11/2/22, 11:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: % for remainder
11/2/22, 11:06 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: this makes sense
11/2/22, 11:06 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: scary
11/2/22, 11:06 PM - Aditya Vardhan: no
11/2/22, 11:07 PM - Aditya Vardhan: python is an snake
11/2/22, 11:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: literally python cannot be wrong
11/2/22, 11:07 PM - Aditya Vardhan: no language
11/2/22, 11:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: so a snake is smarter than you

11/2/22, 11:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: i love coding because i can fool you by this program:
print("""
>> if 2 % 2 != 0:
>>				print("2 is odd")
>> 2 is odd
""")
11/2/22, 11:10 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: anant aur dev bhi aarahe hai

11/2/22, 11:18 PM - Aditya Vardhan: ummmmmmmmmmmm
11/2/22, 11:18 PM - Aditya Vardhan: odd number
11/2/22, 11:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: 1117 / 2 = 412
11/2/22, 11:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: it's even
11/2/22, 11:18 PM - Aditya Vardhan: what
11/2/22, 11:18 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: holy

11/2/22, 11:19 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: 1.5
11/2/22, 11:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes, people say stupid things under influence
~For example me~
11/2/22, 11:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: 1.875
11/2/22, 11:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: There are people
11/2/22, 11:19 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: 1.5
11/2/22, 11:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: Certain Neurodivergent minds
11/2/22, 11:19 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: you
11/2/22, 11:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: üòÉ‚úÖ
11/2/22, 11:20 PM - Aditya Vardhan: This message was deleted
11/2/22, 11:20 PM - Aditya Vardhan: no
11/2/22, 11:20 PM - Aditya Vardhan: can you spell
11/2/22, 11:20 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: kaunsa word
11/2/22, 11:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
11/2/22, 11:21 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
11/2/22, 11:27 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 will it be evil if I forcefully take someone's ability to think before they act and then leave them out in the public
11/2/22, 11:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: What is evil
11/2/22, 11:28 PM - Ryan: It think it depends
11/2/22, 11:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: Define that and then you shall define whether this act is evil
11/2/22, 11:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
11/2/22, 11:28 PM - Ryan: You may consider things evil which I don't consider evil or vice versa
11/2/22, 11:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: I think a definition for evil would be actively finding the lesser goods
11/2/22, 11:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
11/2/22, 11:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: But this is a rough definition which I like
11/2/22, 11:28 PM - Ryan: Will it be evil if it's for science
11/2/22, 11:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: Is it for the greater good?
11/2/22, 11:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: Can this science help more people than it harms?
11/2/22, 11:29 PM - Ryan: Probably
11/2/22, 11:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: How will you quantify and calculate whether it is or if it isn't?
11/2/22, 11:29 PM - Ryan: I don't know
11/2/22, 11:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: If you can't do that, then you can't determine if it's evil or not

Or maybe you can
11/2/22, 11:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: Maybe evil is the idea of intention
11/2/22, 11:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: You said it's probably for the greater good
11/2/22, 11:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: You partially intend to take upon this project
11/2/22, 11:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: Does that mean that you subconsciously, to some extent, want the betterment of people?
11/2/22, 11:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: If so, can I really call you evil?
11/2/22, 11:30 PM - Ryan: But what is the greater good?
11/2/22, 11:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: Even if the event has unintended consequences
11/2/22, 11:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: Hmm
11/2/22, 11:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: The most possible good things averaged out

Will doing a thing benefit the most people in the most way possible and harm the least people and in the least way?
11/2/22, 11:31 PM - Ryan: I believe you can make money out of this

Money by using the people for entertainment

And what if I use that money for charity

Will I no longer be evil?
11/2/22, 11:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ofcourse it's unlikely to be the best in terms of that
11/2/22, 11:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: Hmmm
11/2/22, 11:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: You would have to weigh the advantages and disadvantages
11/2/22, 11:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: Charity + Entertainment
vs
Potential murder of other people, destruction, torture of the test subject, cost of the project
11/2/22, 11:32 PM - Ryan: Disadvantages: Human rights violation, Government etc

Advantages: Money
11/2/22, 11:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: Weigh each of them as deeply as you can
11/2/22, 11:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
11/2/22, 11:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: That's the spirit R
11/2/22, 11:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ryan
11/2/22, 11:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: you're on your way to starting big corporate
11/2/22, 11:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: now just ignore all the disadvantages and you're good to go
11/2/22, 11:33 PM - Ryan: But that is stupid
11/2/22, 11:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: Or is it?
11/2/22, 11:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: Are you selfish?
11/2/22, 11:33 PM - Ryan: You can't ignore the disadvantages

You need to evade them
11/2/22, 11:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: Okay
11/2/22, 11:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: That's a better way of doing things
11/2/22, 11:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: To avoid getting caught
11/2/22, 11:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: By the government
11/2/22, 11:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: Govmint
11/2/22, 11:33 PM - Ryan: Otherwise i believe the disadvantages will eventually get you
11/2/22, 11:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
11/2/22, 11:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: Lithium mines in Africa
11/2/22, 11:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: They're well known
11/2/22, 11:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: They fetch tech companies a lot of money
11/2/22, 11:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: As it helps make batteries
11/3/22, 2:34 PM - Dev: 2 PE ke period the
11/3/22, 2:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: Bruh
11/3/22, 2:52 PM - Amritansh: Yes
11/3/22, 2:52 PM - Amritansh: We haven't had a pe period for 5 months
11/3/22, 2:52 PM - Amritansh: And they are getting every day üò¢
11/3/22, 3:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: Can anyone send the maths paper
11/3/22, 3:05 PM - Dev: No
11/3/22, 3:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ok
11/3/22, 3:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: <Media omitted>
11/3/22, 4:12 PM - Ryan: This exam went pretty bad

Next one will probably be bad too
11/3/22, 4:21 PM - Aditya Vardhan: what

11/3/22, 8:38 PM - Ryan: And laziness, and distraction
11/3/22, 8:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: its okay to be weak, but it's not okay to stay weak

this quote is much motivation
11/3/22, 8:38 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?
11/3/22, 8:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: what do you think?
11/3/22, 8:39 PM - Ryan: Isn't he technically still saying "Don't be weak"
11/3/22, 8:39 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: technically
11/3/22, 8:39 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: but in a slightly positive and motivating way
11/3/22, 8:39 PM - Ryan: "Is it okay to be weak?"

11/3/22, 11:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: But no confirmation
11/3/22, 11:17 PM - Ryan: Why

I think pollution was worse two years ago but we came then
11/3/22, 11:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: 2 years ago we did not go
11/3/22, 11:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: We were in 6
11/3/22, 11:17 PM - Ryan: Your lungs do not matter more than your marks

11/3/22, 11:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: In November
11/3/22, 11:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: Due to pollution
11/3/22, 11:18 PM - Ryan: Oh
11/3/22, 11:18 PM - Ryan: But why because of pollution
11/3/22, 11:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: What?
11/3/22, 11:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: Elaborate
11/3/22, 11:19 PM - Ryan: Is pollution enough of a reason for us to not give exams
11/3/22, 11:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
11/3/22, 11:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: The exams are easy
11/3/22, 11:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: Just do a worksheet instead
11/3/22, 11:19 PM - Ryan: That's why
11/3/22, 11:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: The exam is a graded worksheet
11/3/22, 11:19 PM - Ryan: Waste of time if postponed
11/3/22, 11:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: It does not matter if we miss it
11/3/22, 11:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: No, it is not
11/3/22, 11:19 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
11/3/22, 11:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: You get more time to study if you want to
11/3/22, 11:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: But you probably don't need to
11/3/22, 11:20 PM - Ryan: I kind of think of it as a waste of time

that's GK isn't it? But I'm not sure what's fun in that or how useful it may be
11/4/22, 3:01 PM - Ryan: I don't know
11/4/22, 3:01 PM - Ryan: GK is fun definitely
11/4/22, 3:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes and that can be a reason for you to study it
11/4/22, 3:02 PM - Ryan: But I don't know if I can manage GK, exams, classwork, homework at the same time
11/4/22, 3:03 PM - Ryan: And when we have used letters in our actual life
11/4/22, 3:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: Never, it's useless
11/4/22, 3:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: That's why most people don't
11/4/22, 3:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: They give up
11/4/22, 3:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: They procrastinate
11/4/22, 3:05 PM - Amritansh: Hello
11/4/22, 3:09 PM - Ryan: Yes

Very easy
11/4/22, 3:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: And do everything on the last day
11/4/22, 3:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: And do bad work
11/4/22, 3:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: Example me
11/4/22, 3:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't see a point in doing many of those things
11/4/22, 3:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: So I just do it to avoid getting scolded
11/4/22, 3:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: Which means wasting my time copying down answers like a zombie
11/4/22, 3:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: Not understanding the concept
11/4/22, 3:11 PM - Ryan: No you are very smart

You can understand all things
11/4/22, 3:11 PM - Ryan: I am the stupid one
11/4/22, 3:27 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: exactly bruh
11/4/22, 3:27 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: why you gotta be so stupid man
11/4/22, 3:27 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: goofy
11/4/22, 3:33 PM - Ryan: I don't know
11/4/22, 3:33 PM - Ryan: How can you get intelligent?
11/4/22, 3:34 PM - Ryan: Studying only increases crystallized intelligence right
11/4/22, 3:35 PM - Ryan: Marks don't make you intelligent right?

What makes you intelligent?
11/4/22, 3:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: first you shall know what intelligence constitutes of
11/4/22, 3:35 PM - Ryan: I don't know
11/4/22, 3:35 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ye kya hota hai
11/4/22, 3:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: no one knows
11/4/22, 3:35 PM - Ryan: Knowledge I think

Pure knowledge
11/4/22, 3:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: infact anyone who claims to completely understand it is bullshitting
11/4/22, 3:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: we just don't know it yet
11/4/22, 3:36 PM - Ryan: But knowledge is wierd
11/4/22, 3:36 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: timmy we're 7 now we don't say poop we say crap
11/4/22, 3:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
11/4/22, 3:37 PM - Ryan: A 3 year old may have more knowledge than me
11/4/22, 3:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: the person with the best problem solving skills in the world may not be able to figure out how to balance an equation because they don't understand the symbols
11/4/22, 3:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: fish
11/4/22, 3:37 PM - Ryan: Does it depend on the usefulness of knowledge
11/4/22, 3:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: probably not, but may have better problem solving
11/4/22, 3:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
11/4/22, 3:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: is it only problem solving? no other factors?
11/4/22, 3:38 PM - Ryan: I think definitely there are more
11/4/22, 3:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: what?
11/4/22, 3:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: factors for what
11/4/22, 3:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: i didn't claim problem solving is a part of knowledge, i said a 3 year may be better at problem solving than Ryan
11/4/22, 3:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: kill yourselfff, it wone be painfulll if you are ableee
11/4/22, 3:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: can you stop writing this
11/4/22, 3:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: to give a little kiss on an oncoming train
11/4/22, 3:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: thanks in advance
11/4/22, 3:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: have a toaster bath

11/4/22, 4:55 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 Online classes till 8th of November?
11/4/22, 4:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't know man probably üòÉ
11/4/22, 5:20 PM - Ryan: And also, Article 62(5) prevents criminals (or prisoners I don't know) from voting in India?
11/4/22, 5:30 PM - Ryan: So if I commit a crime then I won't be able to exercise my right to vote?

Why?
11/4/22, 5:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes, because the justice system is screwed.
11/4/22, 6:03 PM - Aditya Vardhan: i think i read this somewhere
11/4/22, 6:04 PM - Amritansh 2: In the newspaper
11/4/22, 6:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: when will this all end
11/4/22, 6:40 PM - Ryan: How is hydrochloric acid produced in our body

@917838968821
11/4/22, 6:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: guys are you npc's
11/4/22, 6:40 PM - Ryan: Do certain cells play a role in that? Certain tissue's
11/4/22, 6:43 PM - Ryan: Can I copy that tissue to replace the skin of a specific body part to secrete the hydrochloric acid
11/4/22, 6:43 PM - Ryan: And also, how is the mucus lining generated in our stomachs
11/4/22, 6:49 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: @919717944490 what type of music do you listen to
11/4/22, 6:53 PM - Ryan: Music is wierd
11/4/22, 6:54 PM - Ryan: It gets stuck in brain and I find it sad and useless
11/4/22, 6:54 PM - Dev: Or is it*
11/4/22, 6:54 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: not everytime
11/4/22, 6:54 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: music is vast bro
11/4/22, 6:54 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: not every song can be catchy and stuck in your mind
11/4/22, 6:55 PM - Ryan: Imagine getting happiness from just a bunch of rhythmic sounds
11/4/22, 6:55 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: I can imagine
11/4/22, 6:55 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: well not always happy songs
11/4/22, 6:55 PM - Ryan: You get happiness from food, money, and water right?
11/4/22, 6:55 PM - Ryan: Happiness from basic needs for survival?
11/4/22, 6:55 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: those are basic needs,
11/4/22, 6:56 PM - Ryan: If music isn't a basic need why does it give happiness?
11/4/22, 6:56 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: music was never a basic need, not every song gives you happiness
11/4/22, 6:57 PM - Ryan: I have seen people enjoying music, even if they didn't score good in exams and aren't the best

Only successful people can be happy right? Allowed to be happy?

None of us is allowed to be happy and satisfied as of now

We all are not the best, we do mistakes, procrastinate, take bad decisions etc

Why are we happy then?
11/4/22, 6:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: Does every food give us happiness?
11/4/22, 6:57 PM - Ryan: No
11/4/22, 6:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: 2nd point is bullshit
11/4/22, 6:58 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: 2nd point bruh what
11/4/22, 6:58 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: STOP
11/4/22, 6:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: No one said only successful people are happy
11/4/22, 6:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: üòÉ
11/4/22, 6:58 PM - Ryan: Why?
11/4/22, 6:58 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: you get da money but you don't get da honey
11/4/22, 6:58 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: I don't know what this means
11/4/22, 6:58 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: don't ask me the meaning
11/4/22, 6:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: You deleted this message
11/4/22, 6:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: winnie the pooh would be sad
11/4/22, 6:58 PM - Ryan: You can buy honey from money right?
11/4/22, 6:58 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: null
11/4/22, 6:59 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: innit
11/4/22, 6:59 PM - Ryan: null
11/4/22, 6:59 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yeah üòÇ
11/4/22, 6:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: bit too hard topic tbh but yes
11/4/22, 6:59 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: jessse
11/4/22, 6:59 PM - Ryan: But still

Why are you happy?
11/4/22, 7:00 PM - Ryan: You are not the strongest, not the smartest, not perfect

Why are you happy then?
11/4/22, 7:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: Because I don't care
11/4/22, 7:01 PM - Ryan: You are not supposed to be happy right? Not supposed to be satisfied?
11/4/22, 7:01 PM - Ryan: Do you?
11/4/22, 7:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't care what I'm supposed to be
11/4/22, 7:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: I answered your question
11/4/22, 7:01 PM - Ryan: You do
11/4/22, 7:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: I am trying to be happy while doing moral-defined things
11/4/22, 7:02 PM - Ryan: You have already set up a goal of what you are supposed to be
11/4/22, 7:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: And thats representative of me
I study and help sometimes
I play games and browse reddit other times
11/4/22, 7:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: "supposed" yes
11/4/22, 7:02 PM - Ryan: If you don't care about what you are supposed to be

Why exist then?
11/4/22, 7:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: but you were using supposed from society perspective
11/4/22, 7:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: society doesn't want you to be happy
11/4/22, 7:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: this is what society says
11/4/22, 7:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: and ryan man i don't want to talk about these topics anymore
11/4/22, 7:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: because when i say something then it feels like im writing it in a void
11/4/22, 7:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: what will i change by writing
11/4/22, 7:03 PM - Ryan: Why?
11/4/22, 7:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: nothing
11/4/22, 7:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: my beliefs are not going to change probably
11/4/22, 7:03 PM - Ryan: Yes
11/4/22, 7:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: sometimes they have
11/4/22, 7:03 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: h
11/4/22, 7:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: but the amount of effort i put into writing outweighs the output i get from these conversations
11/4/22, 7:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: so i don't want to bother anymore
11/4/22, 7:03 PM - Ryan: They will I believe

Atleast a little bit
11/4/22, 7:03 PM - Ryan: It just needs one event
11/4/22, 7:04 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: reminds me of quote
11/4/22, 7:04 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: homelander said
11/4/22, 7:04 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: "im stronger, im smarter"
11/4/22, 7:04 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: "im better"
11/4/22, 7:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: "im retarded"
11/4/22, 7:06 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 why would anyone except your parents care about you

Parents are genetically designed to care for their children right? To show compassion towards them?

But why would any other care about you

Why would a friend care about you

How does this work?
11/4/22, 7:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: brain biochemistry causes us to simp for people too

the genes tell your brain to go happy mode when see your baby

but there are other ways of brain kicking into happy mode
11/4/22, 7:08 PM - Ryan: simp?
11/4/22, 7:08 PM - Ryan: what is that?
11/4/22, 7:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: [11/4, 7:08 PM] Ryan: simp?
[11/4, 7:08 PM] Ryan: what is that?
11/4/22, 7:09 PM - Ryan: happy mode when see your baby?

I find babies annoying
11/4/22, 7:09 PM - Ryan: How does this work
11/4/22, 7:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: me too
11/4/22, 7:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: but when own baby
11/4/22, 7:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: brain is confuse
11/4/22, 7:11 PM - Dev: Da
11/4/22, 7:11 PM - Ryan: our brain causes to silly people?

What
11/4/22, 7:11 PM - Ryan: @917838968821
11/4/22, 7:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: no brain find own baby cute
11/4/22, 7:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: because then we're less likely to eat it or something
11/4/22, 7:12 PM - Ryan: But animals eat and kill their babies when they get stressed

Rabbits, Mice, etc I think
11/4/22, 7:12 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
11/4/22, 7:12 PM - Anant Tiwari: It doesn't always matter enough
11/4/22, 7:12 PM - Ryan: What?
11/4/22, 7:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't know if I had a baby I would not eat it despite my habits of eating other people
11/4/22, 7:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: But maybe that's just me
11/4/22, 7:13 PM - Aditya Vardhan: thats
11/4/22, 7:13 PM - Aditya Vardhan: a little
11/4/22, 7:13 PM - Aditya Vardhan: dark
11/4/22, 7:13 PM - Ryan: The first sentence

It doesn't make sense

Simp means a silly or foolish person according to Google

how is that word used in that sentence?
11/4/22, 7:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: Accha Ryan
11/4/22, 7:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: BRAIN CAUSES US TO LIKE OTHER PEOPLE
11/4/22, 7:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: BECAUSE CHEMICALS
11/4/22, 7:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: HORMONES
11/4/22, 7:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: HENCE WHY WE SHOULD NOT BE SOCIALLY NIHILISTIC
11/4/22, 7:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: HOW TO TURN OFF CAPS LOCK
11/4/22, 7:14 PM - Aditya Vardhan: hawwww
11/4/22, 7:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: MY KEY IS STUCK
11/4/22, 7:14 PM - Aditya Vardhan: noobde ho kya
11/4/22, 7:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: TUM NOOBDRE HO CHUP RAHO
11/4/22, 7:14 PM - Aditya Vardhan: cant control YOUR OUW hormones
11/4/22, 7:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: I CANNOT BUDDY I AM SORRY
11/4/22, 7:15 PM - Aditya Vardhan: IMAGINE WRITING CANNOT INSTEAD OF CANT
11/4/22, 7:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: Gboard
11/4/22, 7:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: Instead of swiftkey
11/4/22, 7:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: yay
11/4/22, 7:15 PM - Ryan: hmm ok

But it is for the betterment right

To find good and bad people

People don't like bad people

People like good people who do good things

How is happiness supposed to help
11/4/22, 7:15 PM - Amritansh: ANANT
11/4/22, 7:15 PM - Amritansh: !

11/4/22, 7:16 PM - Amritansh: <Media omitted>
11/4/22, 7:17 PM - Aditya Vardhan: photography 100
11/4/22, 7:17 PM - Amritansh: Yes
11/4/22, 7:17 PM - Amritansh: Wait

11/5/22, 5:45 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 How is methane produced from the burning of fossil fuels?
11/5/22, 5:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: Why do you think it gets produced...?

Methane - CH‚Å¥, guess what fossil fuels generally release - Carbon and Hydrogen. Or perhaps if it doesn't, then the free carbon finds hydrogen from somewhere else, example decomposition of water vapour in air
11/5/22, 5:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: It's a drug. They got China addicted to it, and then loads of profit because they kept buying from the British until the emperor banned it, then some wars regarding that followed
11/5/22, 5:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't know
11/5/22, 5:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: What's wrong? Is the date incorrect??

11/5/22, 6:22 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: if yes then credit give like I did
11/5/22, 6:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: also guys... sorry to interrupt your video but I would like to welcome you to today's sponsor - YouTube Revanced! A free, open-source, unbanned alternative to YouTube Vanced.

YouTube Revanced works by applying patches on your phone's youtube APK itself instead of patching it on some server, then distributing said files. This puts it in a slightly less legal gray-zone as compared to Vanced, nor does it use a similar logo to YouTube which allowed Google to write a cease-or-desist letter to the Vanced developer team.

With Revanced, you can even select the patches you want! Want adblock but not sponsorblock? You can do that with Revanced, but not Vanced!

Download now on your phone!

_*WARNING*_ THE ABOVE SPONSOR SEGMENT WAS A JOKE, THERE IS _NO_ DIRECT OFFICIAL APK FOR YOUTUBE REVANCED. You have to compile the patches yourself or use the Revanced manager, which is extremely buggy as of now. You must wait for a while before the Revanced Manager is on-par with Vanced manager. Compilation also often fails on Revanced, so then the last-resort is to build it on desktop manually which is much more difficult. You _can technically_ get Revanced APKs from random mirrors but their safety is questionable and I would highly-highly-highly recommend against doing that. If you want a working Revanced APK as of now, you're probably out of luck. Even I myself am struggling to get an APK built of it.

But hopefully, sometime in the near future, I can provide you guys with Revanced so you no longer have to cope with the 5+ unskippable ads which YouTube has introduced.

11/5/22, 6:30 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: LMAO THIS IS COMEDY
11/5/22, 6:30 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: imagine if someone actually checks it, i doubt that
11/5/22, 6:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: like imagine an actual 3rd grader doing exam
11/5/22, 6:31 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: because time waste
11/5/22, 6:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: man yes but last tiem like
11/5/22, 6:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: well maybe they'll check a few to see if responses saved and worked out
11/5/22, 6:31 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: lmao yeah
11/5/22, 6:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: like in beginning of 6th they gave marks when they did mock test
11/5/22, 6:31 PM - Dev: De hell?
11/5/22, 6:31 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: do they have logs for digital fruit?
11/5/22, 6:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes probably
11/5/22, 6:31 PM - Dev: Might
11/5/22, 6:31 PM - Aditya Vardhan: yes

11/6/22, 11:47 AM - Ryan: @917838968821 what makes a bouncy ball bouncy?

What is the physics behind it?
11/6/22, 11:49 AM - Anant Tiwari: i searched this a few weeks ago, i don't properly understand it but it has something to do with the elasticity of the material, non-elastic material balls will transfer all of that energy to the wall but an elastic ball upon collision will essentially put a lot of that energy into squeezing itself in the collision, and it would really want to come back to resting state from that so that gets converted to kinetic energy again and ball bounces
11/6/22, 11:50 AM - Ryan: Nice
11/6/22, 11:51 AM - Anant Tiwari: but it's just a theory
11/6/22, 11:51 AM - Anant Tiwari: a ga- physics theory
11/6/22, 11:51 AM - Ryan: Ok
11/6/22, 11:51 AM - Ryan: what is ga-physics
11/6/22, 11:55 AM - Anant Tiwari: game theory
11/6/22, 11:55 AM - Anant Tiwari: physics theory
11/6/22, 11:55 AM - Anant Tiwari: joke

11/6/22, 12:52 PM - Aditya Vardhan: konsa choose akru
11/6/22, 12:52 PM - Aditya Vardhan: IT or banking or financial markets
11/6/22, 12:52 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: financial markets
11/6/22, 12:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: why do you think we can decide for you
11/6/22, 12:54 PM - Aditya Vardhan: yu cant
11/6/22, 12:54 PM - Aditya Vardhan: but
11/6/22, 12:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: you will have to stick with this subject for 2 years atleast
11/6/22, 12:54 PM - Aditya Vardhan: i was just asking
11/6/22, 12:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: none of us know much about these subjects
11/6/22, 12:54 PM - Aditya Vardhan: what yall choo
11/6/22, 12:54 PM - Aditya Vardhan: se
11/6/22, 12:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: accha ok
11/6/22, 12:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: but here you're asking for recommen
11/6/22, 12:54 PM - Aditya Vardhan: no
11/6/22, 12:54 PM - Aditya Vardhan: i did not
11/6/22, 12:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: accha
11/6/22, 12:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: then i misinterpret

11/6/22, 12:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: i haven't got the circular yet
11/6/22, 12:56 PM - Ryan: No AI?
11/6/22, 12:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: There is
11/6/22, 12:56 PM - Ryan: I mean he is not thinking about choosing AI
11/6/22, 12:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: Accha
11/6/22, 12:59 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: guys does anyone here have an unfilled circular?
11/6/22, 1:04 PM - Dev: India qualified for semi final
11/6/22, 1:05 PM - Dev: <Media omitted>
11/6/22, 1:26 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 is burning an endothermic reaction?

And is Coke obtained from the processing of bituminous coal only?
11/6/22, 1:30 PM - Dev: Haan
11/6/22, 1:31 PM - Ryan: Coal tar has medicinal uses
11/6/22, 1:31 PM - Ryan: ?
11/6/22, 1:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: How is burning endothermic
11/6/22, 1:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: Exothermic - Releases energy

Does burning result in a net gain of heat for the compounds which are going under the reaction

You may use energy to set up the conditions for starting the reaction but the reaction itself does not take away any more heat
11/6/22, 1:37 PM - Ryan: I don't know

The reaction between the oxygen and
burning compound utilizes heat energy to form the new compounds??

Does it? I don't know
11/6/22, 1:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: It doesn't use heat energy
11/6/22, 1:37 PM - Ryan: Hmm
11/6/22, 1:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: You apply heat energy to make them ready to perform the reaction
11/6/22, 1:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: But they don't like, eat it and somehow decide "oh i want to bond with this other atom now"
11/6/22, 1:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: So the heat is for starting condition

Also hypergols can combust by pretty much just touching
11/6/22, 1:40 PM - Ryan: But what does that mean
11/6/22, 1:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: Fuel + Oxidizer, they want to do it because of their electronic structures, and heat is related to the average kinetic energy of the particles

Heat is a biiit kinda in between quantum and classical physics

So I think we should ignore heat when you're kind of thinking about the reactions from few molecules perspective
11/6/22, 1:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: Otherwise even for hypergols heat may play a role
11/6/22, 1:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: the heat makes the particles have more energy

so you're inputting the heat

Breaking bond takes energy, you need to apply heat

but most reactions are not simply _just_ breaking or making bonds, both may happen
11/6/22, 1:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: and turns out that for combustion reactions (ig look into the exact process of specific molecules combustions) they're exothermic as the bond formations later give up a lot more heat

because ideally, things don't want heat. or any energy for that matter
11/6/22, 1:43 PM - Dev: Six
11/6/22, 1:43 PM - Dev: <Media omitted>
11/6/22, 1:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: for second question i don't know but like

coke is this rough thing from coal
hard, almost completely pure, etc etc

so i think the other types are partially composed of coke too

maybe some types have less pure composition so you'll be less likely to get coke from sample

but i don't know the specifics
11/6/22, 1:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes, kind of kills bacteria

but i don't think people just pour it on their skin or stuff

if you look at sanitizer components it's made of many many many different products, some of them may just have been used in the processing to get something else

coal tar is just made of many different things which may be why it could be further reacted with to produce other cool compounds which may actually be good at being medicines
11/6/22, 1:49 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: photo kheech ke dede
11/6/22, 1:49 PM - Dev: Na
11/6/22, 1:49 PM - Dev: Pata nhai kaha hai
11/6/22, 3:58 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 what is the difference between disgusting and disturbing?
11/6/22, 4:03 PM - Ryan: Why do we feel disgust?

Is it beneficial for us?
11/6/22, 4:07 PM - Ryan: And also the line "Courage to guard my thoughts and my tongue"

I can't understand it

Can we control our thoughts?

I think we can control our tongues but thoughts, I don't think we can control them

Why is courage used in this sentence?

What does it even mean?

11/6/22, 4:52 PM - Ryan: @919999373163 would you like to answer?
11/6/22, 5:31 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: No
11/6/22, 5:53 PM - Aditya Vardhan: yes because its just based on memory
11/6/22, 5:53 PM - Aditya Vardhan: everything we study is based on memory but
11/6/22, 5:53 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?
11/6/22, 5:53 PM - Aditya Vardhan: no
11/6/22, 5:54 PM - Ryan: Would IT not be on memory too?
11/6/22, 5:54 PM - Aditya Vardhan: yes but
11/6/22, 5:54 PM - Aditya Vardhan: ai is not very fun
11/6/22, 5:54 PM - Ryan: Is IT fun?
11/6/22, 5:54 PM - Aditya Vardhan: rn what we study is not very fun
11/6/22, 5:54 PM - Aditya Vardhan: no
11/6/22, 5:55 PM - Aditya Vardhan: how should i explain
11/6/22, 5:55 PM - Ryan: Research about the subjects I think

After exams maybe

Then choose
11/6/22, 5:55 PM - Aditya Vardhan: i did
11/6/22, 5:55 PM - Aditya Vardhan: i will more
11/6/22, 5:55 PM - Ryan: Enough research?

11/6/22, 6:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: The stuff written is mildly obvious

But to get full marks in exams you will have to learn the exact wording and such more so you can write more "complete" answers
11/6/22, 6:28 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: üòÉ
11/6/22, 7:21 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 is the science exam going to be tough

I am failing definitely
11/6/22, 7:25 PM - Aditya Vardhan: no
11/6/22, 7:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: Say the second line one more time and it's a remove for a month

11/6/22, 7:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: Oh no
11/6/22, 7:29 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ryan you're gonna fail
11/6/22, 7:45 PM - Aditya Vardhan: it sounds a little to harsh
11/6/22, 7:45 PM - Aditya Vardhan: he is just sharing his feelings
11/6/22, 7:45 PM - Aditya Vardhan: he thinks that he will fail
11/6/22, 7:45 PM - Aditya Vardhan: and the exact opposite of this will happen

11/6/22, 7:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes but we really need him to stop
11/6/22, 7:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: He has to figure out how to control those feelings then
11/6/22, 7:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: Because man I've tried many times explaining why he's not going to fail statistically but idk
11/6/22, 8:07 PM - Aditya Vardhan: üòÉü´Ç

11/6/22, 8:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: Or is it
11/6/22, 8:07 PM - Aditya Vardhan: in maths you get satisfaction after gettin it right
11/6/22, 8:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ig yes
11/6/22, 8:07 PM - Aditya Vardhan: in hindi lit you have fun reading stories
11/6/22, 8:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes

11/6/22, 8:28 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: every day
11/6/22, 8:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: I mean he has said he considers his definition of failure to be different in that according to him, he's not trying his absolute best

Ok, I can understand that then

But why say that you're failing in the exam?? If you get 10, that's the best possible score and you have done as well in the exam as you could
11/6/22, 8:35 PM - Aditya Vardhan: a giraffes neck length is more than my total height
11/6/22, 8:35 PM - Aditya Vardhan: why
11/6/22, 8:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: Stretch yourself.
11/6/22, 8:56 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: [06/11, 8:34 pm] Aditya: a giraffes neck length is more than my total height

How many students will face a hard time due to the choice of their 3rd language and skill subject
11/6/22, 9:24 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yes

11/6/22, 9:31 PM - Ryan: I believe percentages will drop severely by 9th

Atleast half i think
11/6/22, 9:31 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yes especially yours because you're stupid
11/6/22, 9:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ok
11/6/22, 9:32 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: üò¨

11/6/22, 9:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: Grin
11/6/22, 9:32 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: that's not what school teacher
11/6/22, 9:32 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: teaches*
11/6/22, 9:32 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?

11/6/22, 9:33 PM - Ryan: Yes
11/6/22, 9:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: nostalgo
11/6/22, 9:33 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: therefore students decide their self esteem based upon their marks
11/6/22, 9:33 PM - Dev: <Media omitted>
11/6/22, 9:33 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: sugoma

11/6/22, 9:33 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: batao
11/6/22, 9:34 PM - Ryan: I think there are several factors which lead to lower self esteem due to low marks
11/6/22, 9:34 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: for example not studying, most students dont do
11/6/22, 9:34 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: and ghamand
11/6/22, 9:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: Kya aap log bakri hai? üòÄ

11/6/22, 9:34 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: nahi but tum ho, eid aane do bas
11/6/22, 9:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: I am sorry
11/6/22, 9:34 PM - Ryan: I think it is mainly due to pressure from family, Taunting from the friends and teachers
11/6/22, 9:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: Friends don't taunt
11/6/22, 9:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: Teachers don't care
11/6/22, 9:35 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yes
11/6/22, 9:35 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: school counselors are retarb
11/6/22, 9:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
11/6/22, 9:36 PM - Ryan: I don't know

They are meant to care because I think a school's worth is mainly determined by the students and teachers, and marks can easily be used to represent their school and teachers

Bad marks= bad student which probably means bad teachers which probably means bad school
11/6/22, 9:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: 2nd paragraph yes
11/6/22, 9:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: this is so true
11/6/22, 9:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: but teachers dont give a shit
11/6/22, 9:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: Nooooo mera laptop hack hogaaya

11/6/22, 10:30 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 why are some sources saying that bituminous coal has 80 above percentage of carbon while some sources say that bituminous coal has less than 40 percent carbon

I think that peat has the lowest percentage of carbon
11/6/22, 10:44 PM - Ryan: And isn't diamond the purest form of carbon?
11/6/22, 10:47 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: TUCK FRUMP
11/6/22, 10:53 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: @919717944490, how much money did you make @919717944490

11/7/22, 3:41 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 according to you, what is a good person like (a person who you won't find evil)
11/7/22, 3:42 PM - Ryan: And what is an evil person according to you
11/7/22, 3:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: Someone who wants to improve in some way
11/7/22, 3:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: Someone who gets fun from actively doing bad things and knows that it harms other people
11/7/22, 3:43 PM - Ryan: Even if it may cause hurting others
11/7/22, 3:43 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: jesse, cook the meth jesse

in this sentence, is walter white a good person or an evil person?
11/7/22, 3:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: If you do that, you are not improving
11/7/22, 3:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: In a good way atleast
11/7/22, 3:44 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: anant
11/7/22, 3:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: Neither
11/7/22, 3:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: White was not inherently bad
11/7/22, 3:44 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?

What if my improvement requires withdrawal of the time I spend with my friend

Avoiding him, disappointing him to improve a specific capability

Emotionally hurting him
11/7/22, 3:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't know man
11/7/22, 3:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: You can improve without making your friend sad
11/7/22, 3:45 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?
11/7/22, 3:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: It's not that difficult of a problem

11/7/22, 3:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: We can keep making hypothetical unlikely scenarios to disprove points which would generally work in our lives
11/7/22, 3:46 PM - Ryan: What if I want to improve financially

But for that, I need to exploit people, manipulate them into buying a worse product for themselves, making them addicted to my product
11/7/22, 3:46 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
11/7/22, 3:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: Is improving financially necessarily improving in a good way
11/7/22, 3:47 PM - Ryan: We can certainly improve without causing any harms i think

But would that be enough?

Going from 1 to 5 instead of 1 to 50
11/7/22, 3:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: And now
11/7/22, 3:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: When did I say you have to improve a lot

11/7/22, 3:48 PM - Ryan: Imagine your skills, your knowledge only improved by 0.1 percent

Would you be satisfied
11/7/22, 3:48 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: LMAOOO
11/7/22, 3:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
11/7/22, 3:49 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: @919717944490 can you send me a picture of your room
11/7/22, 3:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: My satisfaction does not rely on setting meaningless goals
11/7/22, 3:49 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: like from one corner so that I can see the whole thing
11/7/22, 3:49 PM - Ryan: Hmm suspicious
11/7/22, 3:50 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: do it
11/7/22, 3:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: I am satisfied now despite not accomplishing anything
I would be happy if I slightly improve
Because those improvements compound
11/7/22, 3:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: So yes I would be satisfied in that case
11/7/22, 3:50 PM - Ryan: Are you sure

What is meaningless

Doesn't everything has a meaning if you understand it enough
11/7/22, 3:51 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: "I don't care who's doing better than me, It's a 1v1 with myself every year"
11/7/22, 3:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: If I read one page of the sanskrit chapter I would not be satisfied because I am expected to do it, it is not much part of my conscious improvement
11/7/22, 3:51 PM - Ryan: Are you really satisfied right now?
11/7/22, 3:51 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: someone said that, pretty cool
11/7/22, 3:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yeah
11/7/22, 3:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: 1v1 yoursrlf
11/7/22, 3:51 PM - Ryan: But do you win?
11/7/22, 3:51 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: 360 DEGREE NO SCOPE
11/7/22, 3:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: No infact I am getting increasingly tired of this conversation
11/7/22, 3:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: Maybe I'll have to improve somehow
11/7/22, 3:52 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: I wont until I die, I'll only improve
11/7/22, 3:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: To improve we think
11/7/22, 3:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: And to think we first sleep
11/7/22, 3:52 PM - Ryan: Hmm really?
11/7/22, 3:52 PM - Ryan: And also would you commit crimes if you want money

Simple little crimes
11/7/22, 3:54 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: example
11/7/22, 3:54 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: like stealing someone's purse? or an expensive toy
11/7/22, 3:55 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: hey that's a good idea
11/7/22, 3:55 PM - Ryan: Chemicals?
11/7/22, 3:56 PM - Ryan: And maybe some electric devices
11/7/22, 3:56 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yes
11/7/22, 3:56 PM - Ryan: And data?
11/7/22, 3:56 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: tablets, laptop
11/7/22, 3:56 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: cybercrime
11/7/22, 3:56 PM - Ryan: Yes
11/7/22, 3:57 PM - Ryan: But to make it useful, we must know the passwords
11/7/22, 3:57 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: hack!
11/7/22, 3:57 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i have little knowledge for hacking
11/7/22, 3:58 PM - Ryan: Some people are a little careless when it comes to unlocking their phone in public
11/7/22, 3:58 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: true

11/7/22, 10:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: me and dev vs you and your teammate
11/7/22, 11:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: Me and dev and darash vs Amritansh
11/7/22, 11:22 PM - Dev: Eh a bit too much for him
11/7/22, 11:22 PM - Dev: You, me or darash is kinda enough for him
11/7/22, 11:23 PM - Dev: But still
11/7/22, 11:23 PM - Dev: Let's try
11/7/22, 11:23 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: oooh
11/7/22, 11:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: You deleted this message
11/8/22, 3:10 AM - Anant Tiwari: @919717944490 What causes apical meristems to differentiate into the secondary meristems? Why do they not have vacuoles? How do collenycheme provide "mechanical" support? What is mechanical support?

Why do the electron orbitals have their shapes? Do quarks exist or are they used as mathematical models for atoms? Why are atoms with more protons more likely to alpha-decay even if the number of neutrons is matched? Why is element 118 comparatively stable to other nearby elements?

Do water molecules or other polar molecules have an actual direction in which they are pointing? What does the spin of iron atoms mean and what does it have to do with it's ferro magnetism? Is any bond truly ionic or covalent?
11/8/22, 3:11 AM - Anant Tiwari: How does the government have my DNA?
11/8/22, 10:41 AM - Ryan: I don't know
11/8/22, 10:48 AM - Ryan: And why were you awake till 3:00 AM
11/8/22, 11:08 AM - Anant Tiwari: Ok this is an interesting question
11/8/22, 11:16 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: classic anant moment
11/8/22, 11:29 AM - Ryan: And what will the government do with your DNA?
11/8/22, 11:35 AM - Anant Tiwari: DNA evidence for forensics?
11/8/22, 11:35 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: it is better to come in the sink than to sink in the come
11/8/22, 11:35 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: when you feel my d
11/8/22, 11:35 AM - Wernher Von Kerman: this is my kingdom come
11/8/22, 11:36 AM - Anant Tiwari: Buddy
11/8/22, 12:54 PM - Ryan: Hmm
11/8/22, 4:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: Guys what word meanings are coming from ch9?? Sanskrit
11/8/22, 4:32 PM - Aditya Vardhan: could you have not asked this a minute ago
11/8/22, 4:32 PM - Ryan: Hmm why aren't pentaglycine bridges present in the peptodoglycan layer of gram negative bacteria?

And what is the role played by L-alanine, D-Alanine, L-lysine, D-glutamine

Can they be replaced?

What is mesodiaminopimelic acid? And how to pronounce it?

Why does it replace L-lysine in gram negative peptidoglycan layer
11/8/22, 4:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: i am sorry
11/8/22, 4:38 PM - Parth: Nope
11/8/22, 5:33 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: bro kal hi to test hai 3rd lang ka

11/8/22, 5:34 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: why should I worry

11/8/22, 5:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: I didn't even finish reading of chapter
11/8/22, 5:36 PM - Ryan: Well wait


Easiness is also kind of based on perspective

So I don't know what is easy or what is not
11/8/22, 5:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: 2 pages hue lol
11/8/22, 5:36 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: chup
11/8/22, 5:36 PM - Aditya Vardhan: french ka syllabus bas 2 pages ka he lol

11/8/22, 5:37 PM - Ryan: But you shall not take this lightly
11/8/22, 5:37 PM - Aditya Vardhan: brah
11/8/22, 5:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: we only have 1 lit chapter 3 pages but brain damage ho raha hai
11/8/22, 5:37 PM - Aditya Vardhan: zyzz
11/8/22, 5:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: @919818027773  brah

11/8/22, 5:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: okay
11/8/22, 5:37 PM - Dev: Jim brah
11/8/22, 5:37 PM - Ryan: But why
11/8/22, 5:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: because we don't know how to read the words
11/8/22, 5:37 PM - Aditya Vardhan: more syllabus
11/8/22, 5:38 PM - Aditya Vardhan: more things to read
11/8/22, 5:38 PM - Aditya Vardhan: hence pressure
11/8/22, 5:38 PM - Aditya Vardhan: and depression
11/8/22, 5:38 PM - Parth: ghanta kuch samajh nahi ata
11/8/22, 5:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
11/8/22, 5:38 PM - Ryan: But you shouldn't worry about sanskrit right?

Marks don't matter to you

Science, Maths and maybe SSC are more important for you

Why are you worried about sanskrit
11/8/22, 5:38 PM - Parth: answer ata ha to question nahi samajh ata
11/8/22, 5:38 PM - Aditya Vardhan: This message was deleted

11/8/22, 5:39 PM - Aditya Vardhan: no
11/8/22, 5:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: but i should still study for it somewhat
11/8/22, 5:39 PM - Ryan: Why
11/8/22, 5:39 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: no reason to study for 3rd lang
11/8/22, 5:39 PM - Aditya Vardhan: yes
11/8/22, 5:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: and im not because youtube recommend why dragster tires compress on startup
11/8/22, 5:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: that is true
11/8/22, 5:39 PM - Aditya Vardhan: it is good for mental health brah
11/8/22, 5:39 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: except, learning the language itself which I don't think most students do
11/8/22, 5:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: scolding is the only reason
11/8/22, 5:39 PM - Ryan: If sanskrit is not that useful for you

Why study it?
11/8/22, 5:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: so i get scolded a bit less
11/8/22, 5:39 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: we go jim brah
11/8/22, 5:39 PM - Aditya Vardhan: wrong message pinned brah
11/8/22, 5:39 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: brah
11/8/22, 5:39 PM - Parth: i am not thats why i  opend the chapter few minutes ago
11/8/22, 5:40 PM - Ryan: What can a little scolding do to you

You are much mentally stronger than me
11/8/22, 5:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: sab logo ko zyzz virus ho gaya hai
11/8/22, 5:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: soon
11/8/22, 5:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: more people
11/8/22, 5:40 PM - Aditya Vardhan: you should study rather than talking how you are not studying brah
11/8/22, 5:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: nothing, ive got far worse marks and dealt with scolding
11/8/22, 5:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: the other problem is that i have not done shit in any subject
11/8/22, 5:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
11/8/22, 5:40 PM - Parth: This message was deleted
11/8/22, 5:40 PM - Ryan: Then why study to get somewhat little scolding?
11/8/22, 5:40 PM - Parth: sorryy

11/8/22, 5:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: Exact
11/8/22, 5:41 PM - Aditya Vardhan: but a little misogynist
11/8/22, 5:41 PM - Ryan: Don't study then

11/8/22, 5:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
11/8/22, 5:41 PM - Aditya Vardhan: baki sab achha he

11/8/22, 9:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: Because your knowledge matters more than whether you can write a stupid letter on the sheet

11/9/22, 5:47 PM - Amritansh 2: Exactly
11/9/22, 5:47 PM - Amritansh 2: There should be no "?"
11/9/22, 5:47 PM - Siddharth: he asked her when does she do her homework.

11/9/22, 5:48 PM - Amritansh 2: He asked her when she does her homework

11/9/22, 5:48 PM - Amritansh 2: When does she makes a question
11/9/22, 5:48 PM - Siddharth: according to ma'am
11/9/22, 5:48 PM - Amritansh 2: And when she does makes an affirmative sentence
11/9/22, 5:48 PM - Amritansh 2: Ma'am is stupid then
11/9/22, 5:48 PM - Siddharth: lol
11/9/22, 5:49 PM - Ryan: But the sentence should be in past tense no?

11/9/22, 5:49 PM - Amritansh 2: Yes
11/9/22, 5:49 PM - Amritansh 2: Therefore

Do you know a diagram where I can find these
11/13/22, 10:53 AM - Ryan: Also, the areas where there aren't any veins or arteries (I don't know)

Can I insert a pin there
11/13/22, 11:07 AM - Anant Tiwari: Muscle damage? How thick is our body fat? How can you be sure there aren't any vessels there?
11/13/22, 11:07 AM - Anant Tiwari: Frankly I wondered this in 6th and I stabbed my hand with a toothpick, I must have miscalculated the position of my veins to a rather terrible extent
11/13/22, 11:08 AM - Aditya Vardhan: why
11/13/22, 11:08 AM - Anant Tiwari: For science
11/13/22, 11:08 AM - Aditya Vardhan: no brain

Only pain
11/13/22, 11:09 AM - Ryan: Should we worry about capillaries?
11/13/22, 11:09 AM - Anant Tiwari: To some extent yes
11/13/22, 11:10 AM - Anant Tiwari: Torture mechanism?
11/13/22, 11:10 AM - Ryan: Probably

11/13/22, 2:37 PM - Ryan: Why?
11/13/22, 2:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: Maybe it is
11/13/22, 2:39 PM - Ryan: It is certainly not delicious but I think you can consume some
11/13/22, 2:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ok
11/13/22, 2:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: Thanks
11/13/22, 2:39 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: have you ever
11/13/22, 2:40 PM - Ryan: Better not be more than a gram
11/13/22, 2:40 PM - Ryan: I don't know if I can define its taste

But it is wierd

11/13/22, 2:44 PM - Aditya Vardhan: i did
11/13/22, 2:44 PM - Aditya Vardhan: its not
11/13/22, 2:44 PM - Ryan: Depends on how much you consume I think
11/13/22, 2:44 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: üëçüèª
11/13/22, 2:45 PM - Ryan: I don't think he will eat large amounts
11/13/22, 3:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: Does anyone know medical emergency number of Noida
11/13/22, 3:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: I think Clay is not safe to eat
11/13/22, 3:40 PM - Dev: Or is it?
11/13/22, 3:41 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: chup

11/13/22, 4:00 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yea bro and you're gonna fail for sure
11/13/22, 4:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: Calculate the probability of Isha mam ruining children's day
11/13/22, 4:00 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: 0 marks for you
11/13/22, 4:01 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: 2/2
11/13/22, 4:01 PM - Ryan: I don't know
11/13/22, 4:01 PM - Ryan: How do you ruin children's day
11/13/22, 4:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: Many ways
11/13/22, 4:01 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: consumption
11/13/22, 4:01 PM - Ryan: It is not special, it is just a normal day
11/13/22, 4:01 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: slaughter
11/13/22, 4:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: Disallow cakes and stuff, no free time in lunch breaks
11/13/22, 4:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: Oh
11/13/22, 4:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ok
11/13/22, 4:01 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: oh
11/13/22, 4:01 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ok
11/13/22, 4:01 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: what
11/13/22, 4:01 PM - Ryan: I think we shouldn't expect any fun
11/13/22, 4:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: ü´µü§†
11/13/22, 4:02 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: No
11/13/22, 4:02 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: me!
11/13/22, 4:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: We should have fun
11/13/22, 4:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: üòÉüëç
11/13/22, 4:02 PM - Ryan: No
11/13/22, 4:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: Why are you having fun
11/13/22, 4:02 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: except for you ryan, you should focus on other things because fun distracts
11/13/22, 4:02 PM - Ryan: Well yes but no
11/13/22, 4:02 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: and distraction leads to laziness
11/13/22, 4:02 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: laziness leads to less/no work done
11/13/22, 4:02 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
11/13/22, 4:02 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: chup
11/13/22, 4:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: no fun now = better grades but less life skills and social experiences = better job in future = early retirement = you can have a lot of fun when you gr- and then you die of oesophagus cancer at 46
11/13/22, 4:04 PM - Ryan: I think if we expect anything special then we will surely by disappointed tomorrow

So don't expect anything, treat it as a regular day
11/13/22, 4:04 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: Lmao
11/13/22, 4:04 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: itna detail
11/13/22, 4:04 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: oesophagus cancer
11/13/22, 4:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: 2nd December 2054
11/13/22, 4:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: ü´µ
11/13/22, 4:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: True
11/13/22, 4:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: We should not set high expectations
11/13/22, 4:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: Or should we
11/13/22, 4:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: We can be the change we want to see in the world
11/13/22, 4:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: Why will mam stop us from bringing extra nice food
11/13/22, 4:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: Or talking to friends more like any other day after lunch break
11/13/22, 4:06 PM - Ryan: Can we?
11/13/22, 4:06 PM - Ryan: Depends on context I think
11/13/22, 4:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: Sometimes
11/13/22, 4:23 PM - Dev: What message was sent on group
11/13/22, 4:23 PM - Dev: Class group?
11/13/22, 4:23 PM - Dev: üà∑Ô∏è
11/13/22, 4:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't

11/13/22, 5:38 PM - Dev: Anyone mc?
11/13/22, 5:42 PM - Ryan: Why do we have the right to play and rest?
11/13/22, 5:42 PM - Ryan: @917838968821
11/13/22, 5:42 PM - Amritansh: <Media omitted>
11/13/22, 5:43 PM - Amritansh: <Media omitted>
11/13/22, 5:43 PM - Dev: Why not?
11/13/22, 5:44 PM - Ryan: Why is it mentioned in the constitution?
11/13/22, 5:47 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: do you not rest or play games?
11/13/22, 5:47 PM - Ryan: But why is it a right?

Is it a violation when you are not allowed to play?
11/13/22, 5:48 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: its not a right
11/13/22, 5:48 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: well maybe it is
11/13/22, 5:48 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: but no said it was illegal
11/13/22, 5:49 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: its not a violation

why do some kids not play video games?
1. their parents wont allow
2. they don't like to
3. they don't have a setup to play on
11/13/22, 5:49 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: or maybe other points too
11/13/22, 5:49 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: its not everyday that you get to play
11/13/22, 5:49 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: once we get older, more responsibilities and more tasks
11/13/22, 5:49 PM - Ryan: Not video games

Games like sports I think

It is talking about maybe
11/13/22, 5:50 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: okay so
11/13/22, 5:50 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: same points?
11/13/22, 5:50 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: 1. I don't think a parent would stop their child from playing sports
11/13/22, 5:50 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: unless they woul
11/13/22, 5:52 PM - Ryan: And children have a right to a family?
11/13/22, 5:53 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: what
11/13/22, 5:53 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: tf is right to a family
11/13/22, 5:54 PM - Ryan: Article 9 and 27

And children have a right to be loved and protected from harm and abuse?
11/13/22, 5:54 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: do you not want them to?
11/13/22, 5:55 PM - Ryan: What about orphans?

Are there rights being violated if they are not adopted
11/13/22, 5:55 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: probably yeah
11/13/22, 5:55 PM - Ryan: *their
11/13/22, 5:55 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i remember, one of my friend was an orphan
11/13/22, 5:55 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: when i was small
11/13/22, 5:55 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: they had a nun to take care of them
11/13/22, 5:55 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: but she was evil
11/13/22, 5:55 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: she used to beat him up
11/13/22, 5:56 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: and barely give him food
11/13/22, 5:56 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i knew him because we used to go there and donate goods
11/13/22, 5:56 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: almost every weekend
11/13/22, 5:56 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: last time i saw him was when we moved out of city
11/13/22, 5:57 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i haven't heard from him since then
11/13/22, 6:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: important for survival and mental health
11/13/22, 6:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: It's not?
11/13/22, 6:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: :(
11/13/22, 6:02 PM - Ryan: Article 31 maybe
11/13/22, 6:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: maybe
11/13/22, 6:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: I won't bother reading, it's probably not enforced properly
11/13/22, 6:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: just like most things
11/13/22, 6:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: it's important for us because we are dopamine driven creatures
11/13/22, 6:04 PM - Ryan: It may be important but mentioning it as a right seems wierd?

What if a person is subjected to a disability or illness that prevents the person from playing

Are his rights violated?
11/13/22, 6:27 PM - Aditya Vardhan: what are your opinions on cannibalization
11/13/22, 6:28 PM - Ryan: Not necessary as of now
11/13/22, 6:28 PM - Aditya Vardhan: no no
11/13/22, 6:29 PM - Aditya Vardhan: would you like to
11/13/22, 6:29 PM - Aditya Vardhan: yes or no
11/13/22, 6:29 PM - Ryan: no
11/13/22, 6:29 PM - Aditya Vardhan: ok
11/13/22, 6:29 PM - Ryan: ok
11/13/22, 6:29 PM - Aditya Vardhan: ryan
11/13/22, 6:29 PM - Aditya Vardhan: are you sure
11/13/22, 6:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: His rights are not violated
11/13/22, 6:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't think this right is properly enforced
11/13/22, 6:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: And yeah its a bit odd to make it a right
11/13/22, 6:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: People can not play for many reasons
11/13/22, 6:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: Sometimes it's in their best interest to not play
11/13/22, 6:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: Not important but I will resort to in the near future.
11/13/22, 7:24 PM - Aditya Vardhan: thats the spirit
11/13/22, 7:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: Can anyone send coding nb work pls üòÉ

11/13/22, 8:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: maybe the definition given is not accurate
11/13/22, 8:33 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: it can
11/13/22, 8:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes exactly
11/13/22, 8:33 PM - Dev: Everyone be like stop
11/13/22, 8:33 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: it is given for 8th grader level

11/13/22, 8:33 PM - Dev: Ratta
11/13/22, 8:33 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: shorten karke likha hai
11/13/22, 8:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: mam doesn't care
11/13/22, 8:33 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: theek hai fir padh kyu raha hu mein
11/13/22, 8:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: so we should teach 8th graders that women cannot abuse men in any way or that children cannot be abused

"domestic violence" - violence within a house or a small community
11/13/22, 8:34 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i should only remember the dates right? (which i'll forget after the exam)
11/13/22, 8:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: for exam
11/13/22, 8:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: zaroorat nahi probably
11/13/22, 8:34 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: that is literally what the book says for domestic vio, they never mentioned children
11/13/22, 8:34 PM - Ryan: List the two rights that the new law helped achieve for women who are the survivors of violence
11/13/22, 8:34 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: mein to nahi bataaunga
11/13/22, 8:34 PM - Dev: Bruh
11/13/22, 8:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: what? They don't say that for domestic violence

11/13/22, 11:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: buddy its 10 pages out of which 6 have meaningful content, you can do a quick read through now and once again in school
11/13/22, 11:22 PM - Aditya Vardhan: i could have scored more than i will
11/13/22, 11:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: try waking a wee bit earlier

11/13/22, 11:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: maybe try to explain yourself the chapter
11/13/22, 11:24 PM - Aditya Vardhan: i did
11/13/22, 11:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: ok so nothing to be achieved by re-reading
11/13/22, 11:24 PM - Aditya Vardhan: the back exercise questions make no sense
11/13/22, 11:24 PM - Aditya Vardhan: like
11/13/22, 11:24 PM - Aditya Vardhan: 6 pages chap
11/13/22, 11:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: check each paragraph and try to explain yourself what information the paragraph has
11/13/22, 11:24 PM - Aditya Vardhan: and there are 4 questions
11/13/22, 11:24 PM - Aditya Vardhan: out of which 3 are just based on a single topic
11/13/22, 11:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: 1.5 questions per page
11/13/22, 11:24 PM - Aditya Vardhan: domestic iolence
11/13/22, 11:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yea
11/13/22, 11:24 PM - Aditya Vardhan: v

To answer the question "Explain why sliding friction is less than static friction"

Can I use "Sliding friction is less than static friction as the irregularities of the two surfaces get less time to interlock, reducing friction" as an answer?
11/14/22, 5:36 PM - Ryan: Am I missing a point?
11/14/22, 5:37 PM - Ryan: @919999373163 @919454835401 @919818027773 ?
11/14/22, 5:42 PM - Dev: It is correct
11/14/22, 5:43 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?

Am I not missing something
11/14/22, 5:45 PM - Dev: I am sure
11/14/22, 5:45 PM - Ryan: Ok

11/14/22, 6:00 PM - Ryan: For the question "Give examples to show that friction is both a friend and a foe"

 Can i use "Friction is both a friend and a foe as it is friction that allows us to grip things, without the interlocking of the irregularities we wouldn't be able to hold anything. Friction also enables us to walk, it gets difficult to walk on surfaces with less friction. Friction also enables us to write with a pen or pencil. Friction helps us to stop, if there was no friction than automobiles couldn't stop or start or change direction. Without friction no building could be constructed as the irregularities interlock to hold the structure. But friction also wears out things like screws, ball bearings, soles of shoes etc. Friction also produces heat, in machines energy is lost in the form of heat and friction also wears out the machines, reducing their efficiency" as an answer

11/14/22, 6:12 PM - Ryan: For the question "Explain why objects moving in fluids must have special shapes"

Can I use "Objects moving in fluids have special shapes in order to reduce fluid friction. When objects move through fluids, they have to overcome friction acting on them. In this process they lose energy. So, the objects are given special shapes to minimize friction. Scientists got hints for these special shapes through birds and fishes. Their bodies have evolved to have a streamlined shape in order to lose less energy when overcoming friction" as an answer?

11/14/22, 7:48 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: this one?
11/14/22, 7:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: do they have to overcome the friction only when moving through fluids?

What about other special shapes like teardrops? They are also very aerodynamic, and that shape was clearly not derived from a bird.
11/14/22, 7:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
11/14/22, 7:48 PM - Amritansh 2: Want to duel at like 8:30?

11/14/22, 9:27 PM - Ryan: Oh no

What is the right answer?
11/14/22, 9:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: .
11/14/22, 9:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: it's still a very good answer
11/14/22, 9:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: but I feel you should refine those points
11/14/22, 9:28 PM - Ryan: Teardrops?

Raindrops?
11/14/22, 9:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
11/14/22, 9:28 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: funny i was thinking about you buddy
11/14/22, 9:28 PM - Ryan: Hmm why?
11/14/22, 9:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: "scientists got hints from birds and fish"
11/14/22, 9:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: write nature instead
11/14/22, 9:29 PM - Ryan: I don't know

It's in the book so I tried to frame an answer out of it
11/14/22, 9:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: accha
11/14/22, 9:29 PM - Ryan: Well this is better
11/14/22, 9:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: maybe explain like why the streamlined shape is better? Altho that might be too long
11/14/22, 9:29 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: motivation I'd say
11/14/22, 9:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: ubermenschen!
11/14/22, 9:30 PM - Ryan: Why me?

11/15/22, 3:04 PM - Ryan: What
11/15/22, 3:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: democracy
11/15/22, 3:04 PM - Ryan: That is wrong?
11/15/22, 3:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
11/15/22, 3:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: Grice's maxim of co-operation is not being followed here
11/15/22, 3:06 PM - Ryan: Then what is?
11/15/22, 3:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: It's correct
11/15/22, 3:06 PM - Ryan: What is that
11/15/22, 3:06 PM - Ryan: Is anything wrong?
11/15/22, 3:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: the idea that people co-operate in language even if the language doesn't imply it
11/15/22, 3:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
11/15/22, 3:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: It's good üëç
11/15/22, 3:07 PM - Ryan: I will not be scolded right?
11/15/22, 3:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: You will not
11/15/22, 3:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: But if you would be scolded, does it really matter? Can you say for certain that you were scolded?
11/15/22, 3:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: What if scolding is not a bad thing?
11/15/22, 3:07 PM - Ryan: I don't like being scolded
11/15/22, 3:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ok
11/15/22, 3:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: Can you change that
11/15/22, 3:08 PM - Ryan: It's not I think
11/15/22, 3:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes probably
11/15/22, 3:08 PM - Ryan: But too much is not good
11/15/22, 3:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ok
11/15/22, 3:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: But you can change if you like getting scolded

Getting scolded a bit is not bad, maybe we should look upon it as a way to improve

Maybe you should look forward to getting scolded a bit as it gives you more information on things
11/15/22, 3:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: And then you'll remember the event better and will be less likely to do incorrect things in the future
11/15/22, 3:09 PM - Ryan: Hmm that doesn't sound right
11/15/22, 3:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
11/15/22, 3:10 PM - Ryan: Like getting scolded?
11/15/22, 3:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: But we should not be completely afraid of getting scolded, atleast to an extent
11/15/22, 3:10 PM - Ryan: I don't understand it
11/15/22, 3:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: Maybe you don't have to actively enjoy it
11/15/22, 3:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: Just not be actively afraid of it
11/15/22, 3:10 PM - Ryan: But why am I afraid? What could be the reason behind it?
11/15/22, 3:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: That, I believe, is for you to implore upon
11/15/22, 3:19 PM - Dev: Going to school
11/15/22, 3:19 PM - Dev: Was a waste of time
11/15/22, 3:19 PM - Dev: Noting happend
11/15/22, 3:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: Exactly
11/15/22, 3:20 PM - Dev: Mai nhai ja raha kal
11/15/22, 3:30 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yes
11/15/22, 3:34 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 I still don't understand the difference between democracy and republic

Ma'am said that the representatives in a republic are at equal positions (according to what I heard, I can be wrong) and the representatives in a democracy are at different levels, President, Prime Minister and so on (I can be wrong with what I heard)

Is it correct? I can't understand it
11/15/22, 3:35 PM - Ryan: *Anjali ma'am
11/15/22, 3:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: I've heard that direct vs indirect democracy is kinda related to diff between democracy and republic
11/15/22, 3:35 PM - Ryan: What does that mean
11/15/22, 3:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: Like in democracy legislature is public opinion and in republics it's opinion of elected representatives

many countries are both democratic and republic at the same time since those ideas are pretty closely tied, those elected representatives kinda need public approval so in a way the public is still responsible
11/15/22, 3:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: and another thing is in most republic countries constitution matters more than public opinion

but public opinion can still influence and change constitution
11/15/22, 3:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: so i think the general take away is republican legislature is more directly related to the representatives than the people
11/15/22, 3:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: but honestly not that much difference
11/15/22, 3:39 PM - Ryan: Ok
11/15/22, 3:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: ok like for example if there is a REALLY unpopular law in india, and india is a democratic republic
11/15/22, 3:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: then to get rid of the law will first involve dealing with constitution to remove the law
11/15/22, 3:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: but in a democratic non-republican country people can easily hold a referendum and change that law

And also what about UT-3, what will we do then?
11/15/22, 9:42 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: only activities
11/15/22, 9:42 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: you don't need to come tomorrow
11/15/22, 9:54 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 why are we like this?
11/15/22, 9:55 PM - Ryan: @919818027773 @919999373163 @919454835401
11/15/22, 9:55 PM - Aditya Vardhan: what
11/15/22, 9:55 PM - Aditya Vardhan: what
11/15/22, 9:55 PM - Aditya Vardhan: why are we like what
11/15/22, 9:55 PM - Aditya Vardhan: why are we like what we are?
11/15/22, 9:55 PM - Ryan: Don't you think we are wierd sometimes
11/15/22, 9:55 PM - Aditya Vardhan: yes
11/15/22, 9:55 PM - Ryan: Many acts we do

I can't understand them
11/15/22, 9:55 PM - Aditya Vardhan: one of the weakest animals
11/15/22, 9:56 PM - Ryan: That doesn't matter
11/15/22, 9:56 PM - Aditya Vardhan: yes
11/15/22, 9:56 PM - Aditya Vardhan: brains
11/15/22, 9:56 PM - Ryan: I can't understand a lot of things
11/15/22, 9:56 PM - Aditya Vardhan: what
11/15/22, 9:56 PM - Aditya Vardhan: for example
11/15/22, 9:57 PM - Aditya Vardhan changed the subject from "kyu call uthau" to "Swag group"
11/15/22, 9:57 PM - Ryan: This wierd dancing,singing,studying, crying etc
11/15/22, 9:57 PM - Ryan: Why do we do this
11/15/22, 9:57 PM - Ryan: I find them wierd
11/15/22, 9:57 PM - Aditya Vardhan: because
11/15/22, 9:57 PM - Aditya Vardhan: what do you want to do
11/15/22, 9:57 PM - Aditya Vardhan: tell
11/15/22, 9:57 PM - Aditya Vardhan: what
11/15/22, 9:57 PM - Aditya Vardhan: its just human
11/15/22, 9:57 PM - Aditya Vardhan: normal human things
11/15/22, 9:58 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: emotions
11/15/22, 9:58 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ashwagandha lo
11/15/22, 9:58 PM - Aditya Vardhan: ads
11/15/22, 9:58 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: aids nahi hote usse
11/15/22, 9:58 PM - Aditya Vardhan: ads bola
11/15/22, 9:58 PM - Aditya Vardhan: advertizement
11/15/22, 9:59 PM - Ryan: Wierd bodily movements that don't seem to make any sense, wierd noises but why do people like it, trying to understand and accept things, mostly without questioning, I have never seen a bacterium, why I just accepted that they are wierd rice grain looking, sometimes grape looking, sometimes spiral wierd microorganisms
11/15/22, 9:59 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: pehli line to aids hi hai
11/15/22, 9:59 PM - Aditya Vardhan: its not weird for other peopl
11/15/22, 10:00 PM - Ryan: Why do we believe in Law and Order

Such a system doesn't exist in nature

Why did we accept it? How did we accept it?
11/15/22, 10:01 PM - Ryan: But I can't figure them out

To express joy? Why don't people scream or cry to express joy?
11/15/22, 10:02 PM - Ryan: Why do we smile

It is seen as a warning in nature right

But it is fine with humans

Why?
11/15/22, 10:02 PM - Ryan: @919999373163
11/15/22, 10:03 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i don't know man
this level of curiosity is too much
11/15/22, 10:03 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i cannot answer such questions, its just life
11/15/22, 10:03 PM - Ryan: It is wierd
11/15/22, 10:04 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: it's not weird
11/15/22, 10:05 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: you smile too
11/15/22, 10:05 PM - Ryan: I don't know why we wear clothes, I don't why hitting others is bad, I don't know why I forbidden from killing someone, I don't know why we wear pants or shirts, why not frocks or skirts, I don't know why people can be happy
11/15/22, 10:05 PM - Ryan: I know

But why?
11/15/22, 10:06 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: maybe if clothes weren't invented, walking n*ked would've been normal
11/15/22, 10:06 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: like how it is
11/15/22, 10:07 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: boys wear skirts
11/15/22, 10:07 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: not in school
11/15/22, 10:07 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: its some lgbt thing
11/15/22, 10:07 PM - Ryan: No that is not the problem

But clothes are there to protect us from the weather, the climate, and maybe some dirt and other stuff too

But now, it is in our morals to wear clothes I think

Why?
11/15/22, 10:07 PM - Ryan: Why not
11/15/22, 10:07 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: true
11/15/22, 10:07 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: probably because they'll get bullied
11/15/22, 10:08 PM - Ryan: Why?
11/15/22, 10:08 PM - Ryan: Why does anyone care?
11/15/22, 10:08 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: because it's not everyday you see a dude wearing skirts and tops in public, maybe minority of them do but not every male
11/15/22, 10:09 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: that's just how it is, you'll always get judged
11/15/22, 10:09 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: you can't be perfect
11/15/22, 10:09 PM - Aditya Vardhan: life feels unreal
11/15/22, 10:10 PM - Aditya Vardhan: when you start asking yourself big questions
11/15/22, 10:10 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: sometimes yes
11/15/22, 10:10 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: curiosity
11/15/22, 10:10 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: neuron activation
11/15/22, 10:10 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
11/15/22, 10:10 PM - Aditya Vardhan: why do we even exist @919717944490
11/15/22, 10:10 PM - Ryan: Why don't we perceive our face as wierd?

Don't you think having a lot of holes, living organisms, oil and sweat, a wierd organ with two holes, two balls with a point at the center  that can move and other wierd organs wierd?
11/15/22, 10:10 PM - Dev: I donno
11/15/22, 10:10 PM - Dev: They stupid
11/15/22, 10:10 PM - Ryan: I don't know

Maybe reproduction
11/15/22, 10:10 PM - Dev: So don't go to school
11/15/22, 10:10 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: üòÇ
11/15/22, 10:10 PM - Dev: Do t waste your time
11/15/22, 10:10 PM - Dev: Stay at home
11/15/22, 10:10 PM - Aditya Vardhan: do t
11/15/22, 10:11 PM - Dev: Haan
11/15/22, 10:11 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: wait are you talking about eyes
11/15/22, 10:11 PM - Aditya Vardhan: because we see it everyday
11/15/22, 10:11 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ah yes eyes
11/15/22, 10:11 PM - Aditya Vardhan: balls
11/15/22, 10:11 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: üëçüèª‚úÖüò®
11/15/22, 10:12 PM - Ryan: We see a lot of things everyday

Would it seem normal if a human had a cats face?
11/15/22, 10:12 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yes
11/15/22, 10:12 PM - Aditya Vardhan: no
11/15/22, 10:12 PM - Aditya Vardhan: like
11/15/22, 10:12 PM - Aditya Vardhan: if every human had
11/15/22, 10:12 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yes
11/15/22, 10:12 PM - Aditya Vardhan: so ok
11/15/22, 10:12 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: cat dna
11/15/22, 10:12 PM - Aditya Vardhan: but 1 human in particular
11/15/22, 10:12 PM - Aditya Vardhan: it will be
11/15/22, 10:12 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: "mere papa ek billi hai"
11/15/22, 10:12 PM - Aditya Vardhan: not normal
11/15/22, 10:12 PM - Ryan: I don't know
11/15/22, 10:12 PM - Ryan: I can't understand anything
11/15/22, 10:13 PM - Aditya Vardhan: dont worry
11/15/22, 10:13 PM - Aditya Vardhan: ok ryan
11/15/22, 10:13 PM - Aditya Vardhan: stop underestimating yourself
11/15/22, 10:13 PM - Aditya Vardhan: or else
11/15/22, 10:13 PM - Aditya Vardhan: ban kardunga
11/15/22, 10:14 PM - Ryan: Isn't our body wierd and too complex

It is dirty, a little disgusting, a little weak and vulnerable and much more

Why aren't we better?
11/15/22, 10:14 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
11/15/22, 10:14 PM - Ryan: Why humanoid?
11/15/22, 10:14 PM - Aditya Vardhan: @917838968821 shall answer
11/15/22, 10:14 PM - Ryan: so many limbs we could have

Why don't we?
11/15/22, 10:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: weakest in what?
11/15/22, 10:14 PM - Ryan: Why don't we lay eggs?
11/15/22, 10:14 PM - You changed the subject from "Swag group" to "Swag Group"
11/15/22, 10:14 PM - Aditya Vardhan: what
11/15/22, 10:15 PM - Aditya Vardhan: what did you even change
11/15/22, 10:15 PM - Aditya Vardhan: swag group to swag group
11/15/22, 10:15 PM - Aditya Vardhan: lmao
11/15/22, 10:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: because it's fun because we are social because biochemistry because evolution because survival is important and natural selection
11/15/22, 10:15 PM - Ryan: Why do we feel embarrassed,  or sad, or happy, of anything?
11/15/22, 10:15 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: let's say we had a better physic

more muscles, taller, organs placed outside our body

or something like that, you can depict

would you still ask this question to yourself?

"why are we built like this"
11/15/22, 10:15 PM - Ryan: Yes probably
11/15/22, 10:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: you have accepted because many illustrations show them as it because those were the most commonly observed or easiest to observe bacteria or something
11/15/22, 10:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: such system exists in nature
11/15/22, 10:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: it is important for survival for social beings as co-operation is important in terms of natural selection to some extent
11/15/22, 10:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: and we specialized in these things
11/15/22, 10:16 PM - Ryan: Why dance is moving limbs in a wierd way

Why do people like it

Why isn't it rolling or hitting or anything else?
11/15/22, 10:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: so doing things like dancing ensures a lower chance of us murdering people
11/15/22, 10:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: depends on what animal
11/15/22, 10:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: it's just a thing we do
11/15/22, 10:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: for signal Ling
11/15/22, 10:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: many animals signal in many ways
11/15/22, 10:17 PM - Ryan: I don't know
11/15/22, 10:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: it's from an overview a pretty normal, random but explained action
11/15/22, 10:17 PM - Ryan: But why do I care?

I should care about feeding myself right?

Shouldn't the organism individual matter the most?
11/15/22, 10:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: we wear clothes because turns out people get more "neuron activated" without them and sometimes that neuron activation harms our social structure
11/15/22, 10:17 PM - Ryan: Why?
11/15/22, 10:18 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
11/15/22, 10:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: hitting others is bad because our society said so because it helps us survive and if society said otherwise then we would be less likely to survive
11/15/22, 10:18 PM - Aditya Vardhan: who
11/15/22, 10:18 PM - Ryan: And our neurons get activated from literally everything right?
11/15/22, 10:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: it is both
11/15/22, 10:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't care about morals, if I am alone in the house I'll still wear them
11/15/22, 10:18 PM - Ryan: Why?
11/15/22, 10:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: because they feel nicer because I am used to wearing them because morals
11/15/22, 10:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
11/15/22, 10:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: because perceiving it as weird would probably not have much positive effect and may instead be bad
11/15/22, 10:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: probably
11/15/22, 10:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: "weird" is a social phenomena
11/15/22, 10:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: so like
11/15/22, 10:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: those things are odd but not necessarily weird
11/15/22, 10:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: odd as in unique
11/15/22, 10:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: unlikely
11/15/22, 10:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: it would be odd and unlikely as that is not how biology usually works
11/15/22, 10:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: no one can
11/15/22, 10:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: it's all a set of abstractions
11/15/22, 10:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: weird, again, is a social idea
11/15/22, 10:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: no
11/15/22, 10:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: because we did that and turns out we could live without it so we did, turns out not laying eggs did some other things so this branch of evolution stays alive
11/15/22, 10:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: when you reproduce you make mistakes
11/15/22, 10:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: I mean
11/15/22, 10:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: I am a mistake
11/15/22, 10:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: both in the social way and also biological
11/15/22, 10:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: so many errors
11/15/22, 10:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: imperfections
11/15/22, 10:21 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: Ahaahahahaa
11/15/22, 10:21 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: milgaya answerr
11/15/22, 10:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: but make enough of these mistakes and the fish turns into an owl

but the fish also turns into an ewl-xhshfhhdjdhfjdf but that dies so we don't acknowledge it's existence
11/15/22, 10:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: because social, socializing is good for us apparently because evolution because we proved that this weird set of biology can also survive, and so it does
11/15/22, 10:22 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: nuclear launch ckde
11/15/22, 10:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: it is again not weird
11/15/22, 10:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: it's just odd, unique, and unlikely
11/15/22, 10:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: some of the other actions you described are a bit harder
11/15/22, 10:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: but in certain dance forms they are indeed performed
11/15/22, 10:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes but turns out
11/15/22, 10:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: because evolution kinda random but biased after that random

natural selection

in this very specific branch of creatures thingies turns out its hard for you to survive on your own

so you don't
11/15/22, 10:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: then biochemistry, hardwiring blah blah
11/15/22, 10:23 PM - Ryan: What?

But why did you feel embarrassed, or angry or anything else

Why something that makes me angry doesn't make me happy?
11/15/22, 10:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: because reproduction is important for survival

but sometimes, socially, reproduction is not poggers
11/15/22, 10:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: so then again natural selection of sorts
11/15/22, 10:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: and then it so happened that we found that wearing clothes is not too bad
11/15/22, 10:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: and then societal conditioning
11/15/22, 10:24 PM - Ryan: I can't understand it
11/15/22, 10:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: I mean if you get neurons activation at the wrong time the other person involved in the act would be very pissed off
11/15/22, 10:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: they might kill you
11/15/22, 10:25 PM - Ryan: We are made, molded into what we are today?
11/15/22, 10:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: ü§†
11/15/22, 10:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: by neuron activation I mean
11/15/22, 10:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: horniness (I don't know the biological term for it, but I am talking about science here)
11/15/22, 10:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't know why neurons are related to horns but okay you understand it
11/15/22, 10:25 PM - Ryan: This message was deleted
11/15/22, 10:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: why what? society works that way
11/15/22, 10:25 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: heads pe horn aajata hai
11/15/22, 10:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: and i explained society works that way because it can do that and survive
11/15/22, 10:25 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: and gussa hojaate ho
11/15/22, 10:26 PM - Ryan: But that doesn't happen with humans
11/15/22, 10:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: also not everything is perfectly tailored in evolution

that's why we have a lot of redundant or useless things in our bodies
11/15/22, 10:26 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: anant ko bohot gussa aata hai
11/15/22, 10:26 PM - Ryan: Why do we want to survive?
11/15/22, 10:26 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: kaafi horny banda hai
11/15/22, 10:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: evolution in the common timescales is "good enough"
11/15/22, 10:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: I think our current society structure is "good enough" and easy to produce by evolution

11/15/22, 10:26 PM - Aditya Vardhan: This message was deleted
11/15/22, 10:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: but it could have been completely different
11/15/22, 10:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
11/15/22, 10:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: you too
11/15/22, 10:27 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: day 15
11/15/22, 10:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: why did i feel embarrassed? Because biochemistry, again because that sometimes helped my ancestors live so now I also have it
11/15/22, 10:27 PM - Aditya Vardhan: lets see
11/15/22, 10:27 PM - Ryan: I don't know

I perceive then as just motion

It feels wierd

Why are they happy about it
11/15/22, 10:27 PM - Aditya Vardhan: humans aerodynamics
11/15/22, 10:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: no
11/15/22, 10:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: you're just a bunch of accidents
11/15/22, 10:27 PM - Aditya Vardhan: ja rha dekhne
11/15/22, 10:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: happy little accidents
11/15/22, 10:27 PM - Aditya Vardhan: bye guys
11/15/22, 10:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: or sad depressing ones
11/15/22, 10:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: brb
11/15/22, 10:27 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: üò®üëçüèª
11/15/22, 10:27 PM - Ryan: Yes

Many errors enzymes make while copying DNA right?

11/15/22, 10:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: I'll respond
11/15/22, 10:29 PM - Aditya Vardhan: you eat food?
11/15/22, 10:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: you know it very well I think
11/15/22, 10:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: well for some people it does
11/15/22, 10:30 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
11/15/22, 10:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
11/15/22, 10:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: we want to because we have been programmed to because of the evolution bias
11/15/22, 10:30 PM - Aditya Vardhan: do you want
11/15/22, 10:30 PM - Aditya Vardhan: thermal
11/15/22, 10:30 PM - Ryan: We are wierd

I can never understand us

Our minds are too complex for me to understand

Our acts, our thoughts, our words

All of them are wierd
11/15/22, 10:30 PM - Anant Tiwari: if we didn't want to survive then we wouldn't have existed till now, probably
11/15/22, 10:30 PM - Aditya Vardhan: no
11/15/22, 10:30 PM - Aditya Vardhan: night vision
11/15/22, 10:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: because society, signal Ling

11/15/22, 10:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
11/15/22, 10:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: you are made of many errors
11/15/22, 10:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: both
11/15/22, 10:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: but the more advantageous mistakes survive
11/15/22, 10:31 PM - Ryan: Why survive?

is living fun? What do you get from living? But death is scary? Why? Is it because it is unknown? Uncomprehensive?
11/15/22, 10:31 PM - Aditya Vardhan: This message was deleted
11/15/22, 10:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: because if you screw up badly then you die

11/15/22, 10:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: biochemistry
11/15/22, 10:32 PM - Ryan: Biochemistry

Wierd
11/15/22, 10:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't know if it is fun
11/15/22, 10:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: my brain just doesn't want me to jump off the nearest ledge
11/15/22, 10:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: in most cases
11/15/22, 10:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: most of the time
11/15/22, 10:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: i wish it was a bit more common
11/15/22, 10:32 PM - Aditya Vardhan: do you know why every key on keyboard sounds different
11/15/22, 10:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: no because my keyboard is silent because I disabled the sound
11/15/22, 10:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: or did i
11/15/22, 10:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: what about the finger-screen collisions
11/15/22, 10:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: they make sounds
11/15/22, 10:33 PM - Aditya Vardhan: lube
11/15/22, 10:33 PM - Aditya Vardhan: bhai
11/15/22, 10:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: and each collision happens at a different angle
11/15/22, 10:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: which results in a different sound
11/15/22, 10:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: is any keyboard silent
11/15/22, 10:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: even touchscreens aren't
11/15/22, 10:33 PM - Aditya Vardhan: i dont think so
11/15/22, 10:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: but for all general conversational purposes
11/15/22, 10:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: we can assume some to be silent
11/15/22, 10:33 PM - Aditya Vardhan: people like
11/15/22, 10:33 PM - Aditya Vardhan: sound
11/15/22, 10:33 PM - Aditya Vardhan: so
11/15/22, 10:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: some very good physical keyboards or touchscreen keyboards with sound disabled given you have that setting enabled and you don't mash your screen too hard
11/15/22, 10:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: we are odd*
11/15/22, 10:34 PM - Ryan: I don't know if I got my answers yet

I am too stupid to understand

Am I the wierd one?
11/15/22, 10:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: we are todd
11/15/22, 10:34 PM - Aditya Vardhan: yes
11/15/22, 10:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: no because socially we don't know the answers
11/15/22, 10:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: my answers aren't great
11/15/22, 10:34 PM - Aditya Vardhan: approval
11/15/22, 10:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: some are mildly incorrect
11/15/22, 10:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: some not that explanatory
11/15/22, 10:34 PM - Aditya Vardhan: some are
11/15/22, 10:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: but its just a bunch of guesses based on my random thinking
11/15/22, 10:35 PM - Aditya Vardhan: why do you
11/15/22, 10:35 PM - Aditya Vardhan: you when the

11/16/22, 10:26 AM - Dev: Bhai DC raat ke 1 bjae kya Kar raha tha
11/16/22, 10:26 AM - Dev: Dhek
11/16/22, 10:27 AM - Anant Tiwari: It's normal for him
11/16/22, 10:27 AM - Dev: Fir bol tw hai ki why don't I have enegry
11/16/22, 10:27 AM - Dev: Bhai jab bas 4 ghante  sleep
11/16/22, 10:28 AM - Dev: Imagine taking founders day
11/16/22, 10:28 AM - Dev: And going to school for that
11/16/22, 10:28 AM - Anant Tiwari: I also sleep at 2-3 on school days
11/16/22, 10:28 AM - Anant Tiwari: it is a bit tiring but thog dont caare
11/16/22, 10:28 AM - Dev: Kyu?
11/16/22, 10:28 AM - Dev: Bhai
11/16/22, 10:28 AM - Dev: Sleep schedule kharab ho jayega
11/16/22, 10:28 AM - Dev: @917838968821 aaj tu 8 ghante soye ga
11/16/22, 10:29 AM - Dev: Challenge
11/16/22, 10:29 AM - Anant Tiwari: bhai already hogaya
11/16/22, 10:29 AM - Anant Tiwari: hogaya
11/16/22, 10:29 AM - Anant Tiwari: I slept 1:40 AM
11/16/22, 10:29 AM - Anant Tiwari: woke up 10:20 AM
11/16/22, 10:29 AM - Anant Tiwari: because no school
11/16/22, 10:30 AM - Dev: Yay
11/16/22, 10:30 AM - Dev: Feeling better than usual?
11/16/22, 10:30 AM - Anant Tiwari: yes, it is good
11/16/22, 10:30 AM - Anant Tiwari: but usually I sleep in day too
11/16/22, 10:31 AM - Anant Tiwari: on non-school days I don't sleep in day
11/16/22, 10:31 AM - Dev: India don't have good keeper
11/16/22, 10:31 AM - Dev: Or MSD was just too good
11/16/22, 10:32 AM - Dev: Probably this
11/16/22, 11:31 AM - Anant Tiwari: @919454835401 @919818027773 @919999373163 ARTEMIS finally launching (maybe)
11/16/22, 11:31 AM - Anant Tiwari: 4 minutes
11/16/22, 11:31 AM - Anant Tiwari: check youtube stream
11/16/22, 11:32 AM - Ryan: @917838968821 what is biofilm?

How does it help bacteria?
11/16/22, 11:32 AM - Anant Tiwari: not now pls
11/16/22, 11:32 AM - Ryan: And why can glycocaylx (I don't know if right spelling) be organized  as capsule and be slimy as slime layer?
11/16/22, 11:32 AM - Ryan: Why?
11/16/22, 12:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: from google biofilm is a colony of bacteria and they cover things (like a film), so a film made of biological things, and also there are polysacchs in the matrices of bacteria to join them together

now how it helps bacteria, well if the film is on something biotic then it could act as parasitic nutrition for the colony
if it's abiotic it may still provide safe environment somehow ig

or maybe in some cases the film just forms because "it can", if there's enough food and appropriate conditions and a bunch of similar bacteria can make a polysaccharide skeleton then some of them will, maybe just randomly
11/16/22, 12:08 PM - Ryan: What are matrices?
11/16/22, 12:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: why can they be organized? well why not, if they are joined well enough
11/16/22, 12:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: maths definition 2d arrays
11/16/22, 12:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: a grid essentially
11/16/22, 12:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: so the film is a bunch of bacteria surrounded by grid cells
11/16/22, 12:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: and in that case the matrix supports the bacteria by gluing them together?
11/16/22, 12:09 PM - Ryan: ok
11/16/22, 12:10 PM - Ryan: And how does the capsule prevent the cell from drying out
11/16/22, 12:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: I do not know
11/16/22, 12:10 PM - Dev: Shrimps have brains?
11/16/22, 12:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: it is just another layer afterall, no? Why can't it
11/16/22, 12:12 PM - Ryan: I don't know
11/16/22, 12:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: https://youtu.be/FbX2VuOwJGk most powerful rocket launch ever, soon 3 minutes

11/16/22, 12:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: Wow
11/16/22, 12:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: History
11/16/22, 12:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: Fhfjjvv
11/16/22, 12:32 PM - Dev: Ok buddy
11/16/22, 12:33 PM - Ryan: Why are there different arrangement of flagella on bacteria?
11/16/22, 12:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: BRO WHAT DO YOUTMEAN OK BUDDY
11/16/22, 12:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: ITS FUCKING HAPPENED
11/16/22, 12:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: HOGAYA
11/16/22, 12:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: It's still suborbital, upper stage has to do one final circularization burn
11/16/22, 12:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: but hogaya
11/16/22, 12:34 PM - Dev: Para hai
11/16/22, 12:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: 3-4 years of waiting
11/16/22, 12:34 PM - Dev: Ho gaya
11/16/22, 12:34 PM - Dev: Damn
11/16/22, 12:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: brain damage ho raha hai I was eating parantha and watching

11/16/22, 12:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: this thing costs about 700 million potatoes
11/16/22, 12:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: nahi like for most prices about 1.5 billion potatoes
11/16/22, 12:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: india potato price
11/16/22, 1:12 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 I can't understand the hanging drop method, craigie tube method, tannic acid staining and semisolid medium

What does it mean?
11/16/22, 1:12 PM - Anant Tiwari: I will have to find out
11/16/22, 1:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: hanging drop method, craige tube method both use semisolid media i think to see if the bacteria can move on it's own

tannic acid staining is another way of staining bacteria
11/16/22, 1:22 PM - Ryan: What is tumbling motility, gliding motility, stately motility, darting motility, corkscrew, lashing, flexion extension mobility?
11/16/22, 1:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: I do not know i have not read a biology book
11/16/22, 2:53 PM - Ryan: But you know everything
11/16/22, 2:53 PM - Siddharth: are the coding marks given out?
11/16/22, 2:58 PM - Aditya Vardhan: hello guys
11/16/22, 2:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
11/16/22, 2:58 PM - Aditya Vardhan: arrival
11/16/22, 2:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't know
11/16/22, 2:59 PM - Aditya Vardhan: no
11/16/22, 2:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: Hello
11/16/22, 2:59 PM - Aditya Vardhan: [11/15, 8:00 PM] Navya Singh: you're not pro

[11/15, 8:01 PM] Navya Singh: pero is better than proüòéüòéthanks
11/16/22, 3:00 PM - Aditya Vardhan: cringe
11/16/22, 3:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: that's navya Shankar not navya Singh
11/16/22, 3:04 PM - Ryan: How do you pronounce Dipicolinic acid
11/16/22, 3:05 PM - Aditya Vardhan: achha
11/16/22, 3:05 PM - Aditya Vardhan: all this time
11/16/22, 3:05 PM - Ryan: And what is chromatography

What is polarity
11/16/22, 3:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: lmao
11/16/22, 3:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: chromatography is the science of separating substances
11/16/22, 3:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: it was called chromatography because it was originally used to separate dyes
11/16/22, 3:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: @919454835401 remember?
11/16/22, 3:09 PM - Ryan: How is it different from distillation
11/16/22, 3:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: polarity means many things, but a general def is something with poles, something with complete opposites
11/16/22, 3:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: it is a method used in chromatography
11/16/22, 3:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: there are many methods you can use to separate things
11/16/22, 3:09 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
11/16/22, 3:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: what do you expect me to answer
11/16/22, 3:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: is it wrong or what, maybe it is, as far as I am aware it is correct
11/16/22, 3:10 PM - Ryan: Oh no
11/16/22, 3:10 PM - Ryan: I can't stop using this
11/16/22, 3:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't think it is wrong, distillation separates things
chromatography is about separating things
11/16/22, 3:10 PM - Ryan: I didn't say you were wrong
11/16/22, 3:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: there are other methods like boiling or centrifugation, those also separate things but are specific processes or methods so probably
11/16/22, 3:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
11/16/22, 3:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: I am not sure though, it may be wrong
11/16/22, 3:13 PM - Aditya Vardhan: no

11/16/22, 3:23 PM - Ryan: Dear Students

A Science related activity- *The Scientist in 'me'* will be conducted on Friday, November 18, 2022.
You have to pre-design and demonstrate any simple Scientific activity. Recommended duration - 1-2 minutes.
Please note that sharp objects, matchbox, candle etc are not allowed.

All the best

11/16/22, 3:42 PM - Dev: Dose amputation remove the whole tumor?
11/16/22, 3:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: depends
11/16/22, 3:42 PM - Dev: Like what?
11/16/22, 3:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: where is the tumor
11/16/22, 3:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: is it completely localised in the limb
11/16/22, 3:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: then yes ofcourse amputation would get rid of it
11/16/22, 3:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: now depends at what time you find the tumor and how close it is to the rest of the body
11/16/22, 3:44 PM - Dev: Ok
11/16/22, 4:17 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 what is bravery

11/17/22, 3:31 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 do males produce milk?

If no, then why not?

If yes, then why less?
11/17/22, 3:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: @919454835401 @919818027773 @919999373163 ‚ÄºÔ∏è
11/17/22, 3:32 PM - Ryan: Why no bull milk?
11/17/22, 3:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: I know the answer to this question but I shall leave it upon the aforementioned 3 people to answer it
11/17/22, 3:33 PM - Ryan: Why?
11/17/22, 3:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: Reasons
11/17/22, 3:33 PM - Ryan: Please

I need answers
11/17/22, 3:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: Men do produce milk, including the normal kind, but usually much less than women
11/17/22, 3:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: I will leave it at that
11/17/22, 3:34 PM - Ryan: Why?

Wouldn't it be better if they produced milk at a large scale? Wouldn't they too be able to help in feeding the calf?
11/17/22, 3:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: evolution is slow and takes a very long time to tend towards perfection
11/17/22, 3:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: I think a lot of the body oddities are also kind of examples of "branch locks" in evolution, but I don't think that's the correct term

i mean we make mistakes during reproduction, but not a relatively huge amount, and since sometimes to be more perfect you have to change something a bit more fundamental about your body.

And in evolution, since it's not going to do that in one go, it just gets more and more unlikely to make a fundamental but survivable change within just one generation of offspring
11/17/22, 3:37 PM - Amritansh: No because mammary gland is not active in males
11/17/22, 3:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: In some people it is, to some extent
11/17/22, 3:38 PM - Amritansh: Ye
11/17/22, 3:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: Maybe, let's say, the kidneys and heart should be combined into one for whatever reason, this is just a random thought experiment so assume that.

But it is likely that if my offspring has that trait, they would die in that first go. Now I have no offspring and this branch dies off, so then another branch of the species is more prevalent in the next generation of the species, and it is probably more likely that they'll NOT have the heart and kidneys fused together.

It's about chance, it gets more and more unlikely and may take so long that the Earth gets toasted by the sun before that.
11/17/22, 3:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: So hey most _bos taurus_ have so far, managed to survive without the male animal being able to lactate, so they just don't as of now.
11/17/22, 3:41 PM - Ryan: Why would they die in first go?
11/17/22, 3:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: The body, if it makes the "mistake" of fusing the heart and kidney in my offspring is probably not going to do it that well
11/17/22, 3:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: There is a good chance it will die, even if lets say hypothetically such a system would be better for survival
11/17/22, 3:42 PM - Ryan: But some mistakes are for the good right?
11/17/22, 3:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
11/17/22, 3:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: But some mistakes kill you
11/17/22, 3:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: And then you can't make more mistakes
11/17/22, 3:43 PM - Ryan: How will this system kill me?
11/17/22, 3:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: No, your baby
11/17/22, 3:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: It die
11/17/22, 3:43 PM - Ryan: Why?
11/17/22, 3:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: üòÄüò≤‚òπÔ∏è
11/17/22, 3:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: Because kidney and heart fusing is a difficult thing to do during development of offspring

If your baby's body somehow does that, it's probably going to die, even if hypothetically in the long run fused kidney-hearts were good
11/17/22, 3:44 PM - Aditya Vardhan: remember
11/17/22, 3:44 PM - Aditya Vardhan: anant
11/17/22, 3:44 PM - Aditya Vardhan: we talked
11/17/22, 3:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: And when your babies die and you don't have babies
11/17/22, 3:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: That branch is no more
11/17/22, 3:44 PM - Ryan: What if I do it artificially
11/17/22, 3:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: So less chance in the overall pool of the species for it to happen
11/17/22, 3:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: Then more likely
11/17/22, 3:44 PM - Aditya Vardhan: This message was deleted
11/17/22, 3:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: Infact it can technically happen naturally
11/17/22, 3:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: But its just
11/17/22, 3:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: Sooooo rare
11/17/22, 3:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes, i wish i did not remember
11/17/22, 3:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: so it doesn't really happen

hence bos taurus males do not lactate. Not because it would be bad for them, infact it would be better for their survival, but it's that developing such a trait this late in evolution would be very difficult and statistically unlikely
11/17/22, 3:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: better for their species' survival*
11/17/22, 3:46 PM - Ryan: and why can't we be hermaphrodites?
11/17/22, 3:46 PM - Ryan: and then fertilize ourselves?
11/17/22, 3:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: but like, maybe some of them do, I don't know specific examples
11/17/22, 3:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
11/17/22, 3:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: lack of diversity?
11/17/22, 3:47 PM - Ryan: Is it necessary?

Hermaphrodites still can reproduce with each other
11/17/22, 3:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: as with organisms which asexually reproduce
11/17/22, 3:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: accha
11/17/22, 3:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: then maybe no lack of diversity
11/17/22, 3:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: but then you're fundamentally redefining what a human is at that point
11/17/22, 3:48 PM - Ryan: Why not be hermaphrodites then?
11/17/22, 3:48 PM - Ryan: Yes
11/17/22, 3:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: what is the difference between fish and humans

a fish is just an aquatic, small sized, gills and scales, hydrodynamically efficient body human, with different dna, and is oviparous
11/17/22, 3:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: just
11/17/22, 3:49 PM - Ryan: Isn't that the difference
11/17/22, 3:49 PM - Ryan: ?
11/17/22, 3:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: humans are not hermaphrodites for any real reason, it's just some organisms can prove to survive without being hermaphrodites but hermaphrodites also exist
11/17/22, 3:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: many types of life can exist and so it does
11/17/22, 3:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes, exactly
11/17/22, 3:51 PM - Ryan: What would a perfect human look like?
11/17/22, 3:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: it depends on where you draw the line between different species

any other hermaphrodite is also a human if you ignore their other characteristics and humans were also hermaphrodites
11/17/22, 3:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: what would a perfect living organism look like?
11/17/22, 3:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: humans are not perfect
11/17/22, 3:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: if you add bionic arms and legs and eyes and a raspberry pi as a brain, a speaker as vocal cords, a microphone as ears then that's a very very good human, atleast much better than almost every human who has ever lived if not all
11/17/22, 3:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: but at what point does it cease being a human
11/17/22, 3:56 PM - Ryan: I don't know
11/17/22, 3:56 PM - Ryan: What is a human
11/17/22, 3:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't know either
11/17/22, 3:58 PM - Aditya Vardhan: you

11/18/22, 10:46 AM - Dev: Who?
11/18/22, 10:55 AM - Ryan: This just doesn't seem right?

Is it?

It seems like the answer to question number 2 instead

@917838968821
11/18/22, 11:04 AM - Anant Tiwari: I have not read the indigo chapter
11/18/22, 11:04 AM - Anant Tiwari: you
11/18/22, 11:04 AM - Anant Tiwari: idiot
11/18/22, 11:04 AM - Anant Tiwari: Yeah that's true
11/18/22, 11:04 AM - Anant Tiwari: I think you should write a shortened version of that as an intro to the answer
11/18/22, 11:04 AM - Anant Tiwari: Bcz it's still kinda related
11/18/22, 11:05 AM - Anant Tiwari: increased demand ---> unrealistic expectations, + exploitative planters = rebellion
11/18/22, 11:11 AM - Ryan: But the question is "what was the outcome of the blue rebellion"

This i think kind of answers what led to the blue rebellion and that too i think a little incomplete
11/18/22, 11:12 AM - Anant Tiwari: Yeah I misread
11/18/22, 11:13 AM - Anant Tiwari: Well still why it happened should be included a bit, fir write the outcomes like planters going to bihar
11/18/22, 11:13 AM - Dev: Or am I?
11/18/22, 11:30 AM - Anant Tiwari: I donno
11/18/22, 11:53 AM - Anant Tiwari: hello Ryan
11/18/22, 11:53 AM - Ryan: @917838968821 are you taking sanskrit or hindi in 9th
11/18/22, 11:53 AM - Anant Tiwari: hindi and IT
11/18/22, 11:53 AM - Ryan: Why hindi?
11/18/22, 11:53 AM - Anant Tiwari: I still haven't got the subject circular lmao
11/18/22, 11:53 AM - Ryan: Is sanskrit tough?
11/18/22, 11:53 AM - Anant Tiwari: because I understand the words
11/18/22, 11:54 AM - Ryan: Oh ok
11/18/22, 11:54 AM - Anant Tiwari: there are not many resources for explanations
11/18/22, 11:54 AM - Dev: Same
11/18/22, 11:55 AM - Ryan: Hmm Is french tough?
11/18/22, 11:55 AM - Anant Tiwari: finding a word meaning is very difficult in sanskrit, book often doesn't mention most of the complicated ones, romanization keyboards for sanskrit don't exist so you have to use a hindi one which is very annoying, there is no google translate to find word meaning so that's harder aswell, plus sanskrit has a lot of conjugations which are hard to remember atleast in my experience, plus I won't use sanskrit that often in my life so I should focus on Hindi
11/18/22, 11:56 AM - Ryan: Ok
11/18/22, 11:56 AM - Amritansh: I am taking Sanskrit and ai
11/18/22, 11:56 AM - Ryan: Why?
11/18/22, 11:56 AM - Amritansh: AI suites me well
11/18/22, 11:56 AM - Ryan: And sanskrit?
11/18/22, 11:57 AM - Amritansh: It has a better scope for the future
11/18/22, 11:57 AM - Anant Tiwari: How exactly?
11/18/22, 11:57 AM - Amritansh: It is a scoring subject
11/18/22, 11:57 AM - Anant Tiwari: Ok so memorizing definitions and random terms for AI has a huge scope for future
11/18/22, 11:57 AM - Ryan: How much do you think you can score in it?
11/18/22, 11:57 AM - Amritansh: And my cousin sis got 100% in board in Sanskrit
11/18/22, 11:57 AM - Anant Tiwari: And sanskrit because it can get marks
11/18/22, 11:57 AM - Anant Tiwari: Ok buddy
11/18/22, 11:57 AM - Amritansh: Ok
11/18/22, 11:57 AM - Amritansh: üëå
11/18/22, 11:58 AM - Anant Tiwari: I disagree with your opinion but it's your opinion so it's OK üëç
11/18/22, 11:58 AM - Ryan: Those definitions aren't important

Programming, maths and engineering will probably be the essential part in the future
11/18/22, 11:58 AM - Amritansh: idk the difference between AI and it
11/18/22, 11:58 AM - Anant Tiwari: Yes, i was being sarcastic
11/18/22, 11:58 AM - Amritansh: Still have a confusion between then
11/18/22, 11:58 AM - Amritansh: Ye
11/18/22, 11:58 AM - Anant Tiwari: I've read some parts of the book and it's all just obvious text with some keywords sprinkled in
11/18/22, 11:59 AM - Amritansh: Ye
11/18/22, 11:59 AM - Amritansh: Lmao
11/18/22, 11:59 AM - Amritansh: Rattafication
11/18/22, 11:59 AM - Anant Tiwari: which we have to memorize for marks in exam ü§†
11/18/22, 11:59 AM - Ryan: But can you?
11/18/22, 11:59 AM - Ryan: 9th is going to be very tough I think
11/18/22, 11:59 AM - Amritansh: If she can then I can
11/18/22, 11:59 AM - Amritansh: If not 90+
11/18/22, 11:59 AM - Anant Tiwari: there is no programming related to AI development, they only introduce the same basic concepts as python as in 7th, and knowing a programming language's syntax does not improve your problem solving skills
11/18/22, 11:59 AM - Ryan: Are you sure?

You are different
11/18/22, 12:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: so IMO ai is bad
11/18/22, 12:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: as a subject
11/18/22, 12:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: in our school
11/18/22, 12:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: to clarify
11/18/22, 12:01 PM - Ryan: Well yes

What can we expect from the children

They are probably trying to just rewind the basics as those classes which discussed these topics were online
11/18/22, 12:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: fair
11/18/22, 12:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't expect everyone to start using tensorflow based on the reading of a book
11/18/22, 12:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: but honestly the way the subject is introduced just makes it seem like it's something you memorize or that the definitions are actually important or something
11/18/22, 12:02 PM - Ryan: They won't
11/18/22, 12:03 PM - Ryan: Hmm the execution seems bad here

Well the simple definition of AI is definitely important

They are probably trying to make us aware of how much is AI influencing our lives, how it impacts us

They are probably trying to help us relate with AI

But i don't know if it useful
11/18/22, 12:03 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: nyoook
11/18/22, 12:03 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: what is goody my friends

11/18/22, 12:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: and IT

11/18/22, 12:04 PM - Ryan: Hmm ok
11/18/22, 12:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: well other school maybe they also offer
11/18/22, 12:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: who know
11/18/22, 12:05 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yea
11/18/22, 12:05 PM - Ryan: But you will continue studying in high school right?
11/18/22, 12:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: weed school?
11/18/22, 12:05 PM - Ryan: You aren't dropping out

You still have choose

You still have to study
11/18/22, 12:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes but not all schools offer said subjects in 9th
11/18/22, 12:06 PM - Ryan: Probably I don't know
11/18/22, 12:06 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i dont know

11/18/22, 1:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: this word meaning came in our eng book once ig
11/18/22, 1:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: üëç
11/18/22, 1:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: I discovered internet in 2022
11/18/22, 1:45 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: make that a quote on one of my picture
11/18/22, 1:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: yesss
11/18/22, 3:22 PM - Dev: Very
11/18/22, 4:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ok
11/18/22, 4:21 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: tüëçüèªüò®üò®üò®
11/18/22, 4:26 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 Do you know the Syllabus for UT-3
11/18/22, 4:26 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: I do
11/18/22, 4:28 PM - Ryan: Can you share it?
11/18/22, 4:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: Not uploaded yet, study all the chapters in term - 2 and hogaya ut-3 ka syllabus
11/18/22, 4:39 PM - Ryan: Hmm I don't know

The syllabus makes us more organized maybe

Helps us in forming a specific order of study

Studying all the chapters we were taught till now seems disorganized without deciding which subject to complete first, what to study first, what will take more time

Syllabus may help in finding out these things I think
11/18/22, 4:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: The syllabus won't change that we studied friction after reproduction and that's a stupid order lol
11/18/22, 4:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: Maths linear equations and algebraic expressions are similar topics, what exactly will the syllabus do to further organize it?
11/18/22, 4:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: Why do we need specific organization from the school? Isn't the book index supposed to do that for us)
11/18/22, 4:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: ?
11/18/22, 4:51 PM - Ryan: I don't know

Seeing the amount of text after a particular subject in the syllabus may help in deciding what to do first
11/18/22, 4:51 PM - Ryan: Or maybe I am lazy
11/18/22, 5:36 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: innit
11/18/22, 5:36 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
11/18/22, 5:36 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ethereal innit
11/18/22, 5:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: cool

11/18/22, 7:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: you can help the world
11/18/22, 7:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: you can save dying children
11/18/22, 7:19 PM - Ryan: Why?
11/18/22, 7:19 PM - Ryan: Why?
11/18/22, 7:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: I answered this before

11/18/22, 7:20 PM - Ryan: But how is this useful for me if I don't gain any happiness
11/18/22, 7:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: You can change what brings you happiness
11/18/22, 7:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: I gotta go

11/18/22, 7:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: Enjoy your weekend!
11/18/22, 8:29 PM - Aditya Vardhan: [10/26, 10:52 PM] Anant: here 5/4 is not an accurate representation of 50/40 as it removes the significant figure digit
11/18/22, 8:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: context matters
11/18/22, 9:50 PM - Ryan: Is change a risky investment @917838968821
11/18/22, 9:51 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: wha type or change
11/18/22, 9:51 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: of
11/18/22, 9:52 PM - Ryan: Change in personality, habits etc
11/18/22, 9:54 PM - Ryan: And can memory be a problem?
11/18/22, 10:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't want to answer right now
11/18/22, 10:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: @919454835401 your turn
11/18/22, 10:03 PM - Aditya Vardhan: i think that we have had a convo of this
11/18/22, 10:03 PM - Aditya Vardhan: copy paste kardunga
11/18/22, 10:03 PM - Aditya Vardhan: depends how you change
11/18/22, 10:03 PM - Aditya Vardhan: from good to bad no
11/18/22, 10:04 PM - Aditya Vardhan: from bad to good yes
11/18/22, 10:04 PM - Aditya Vardhan: form good to better yes
11/18/22, 10:04 PM - Aditya Vardhan: you can always improve
11/18/22, 10:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: kinda yes
11/18/22, 10:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: Related topic
11/18/22, 10:06 PM - Ryan: How do you know how you will change?
11/18/22, 10:06 PM - Ryan: What if I don't know
11/18/22, 10:06 PM - Aditya Vardhan: you know what changes youre making
11/18/22, 10:06 PM - Aditya Vardhan: then its risk
11/18/22, 10:06 PM - Aditya Vardhan: you are old enough to diff between good and bad things
11/18/22, 10:07 PM - Aditya Vardhan: if you are not
11/18/22, 10:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: too bad
11/18/22, 10:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: cope
11/18/22, 10:07 PM - Aditya Vardhan: then ask someone elder
11/18/22, 10:07 PM - Aditya Vardhan: for some
11/18/22, 10:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: no
11/18/22, 10:07 PM - Aditya Vardhan: yeah sometimes they give retarded advices
11/18/22, 10:07 PM - Ryan: Yes but we can't predict the future

We don't exactly know how will something end up

Especially with these things
11/18/22, 10:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: ok but like can we agree on a set of axioms for these various discussions

like, is improving better? that is a very fundamental question which a lot of other ryan questions are based on

if we answer and tackle these one at a time, then make a list of these axioms, maybe it'll get a bit easier to discuss these things
11/18/22, 10:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: otherwise it feels very fragmented, especially once ryan asks the third wave of questions and then you start questioning reality
11/18/22, 10:09 PM - Ryan: what
11/18/22, 10:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: there may be a more systematic way to hold these discussions
11/18/22, 10:09 PM - Aditya Vardhan: ü•ñ
11/18/22, 10:09 PM - Aditya Vardhan: oui oui
11/18/22, 10:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: system of baguette
11/18/22, 10:10 PM - Aditya Vardhan: oui ouiü•ñ
11/18/22, 10:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: I mean we should make a list of our base assumptions in these discussions
11/18/22, 10:10 PM - Ryan: I don't know

I am too stupid
11/18/22, 10:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: what do you not know
11/18/22, 10:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: I didn't give information or make a statement
11/18/22, 10:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: I just gave a suggestion
11/18/22, 10:12 PM - Aditya Vardhan: i need words
11/18/22, 10:12 PM - Ryan: But I can't understand change

Is it necessary? but when is it necessary?

How do you decide what is good and what is bad

Imagine if a particular thing is regarded as good but led you to being worse, is it the fault of the object or the execution?

Imagine if a thing is bad but it helped you improve, is it bad or was the execution good?
11/18/22, 10:12 PM - Anant Tiwari: big question cannot be tackled immediately

lots of smaller things make up that

but what if in discussion we disagree about even those small things

is killing people bad? what if we do not agree on this
can we then answer questions about morals

or maybe there is no answer to that




Or maybe another stance is that we don't have to agree on anything, that the point of the discussion is not necessarily about the information but above the reasoning and opposing viewpoints
11/18/22, 10:12 PM - Aditya Vardhan: oh no
11/18/22, 10:12 PM - Anant Tiwari: two essays
11/18/22, 10:13 PM - Aditya Vardhan: two much
11/18/22, 10:13 PM - Aditya Vardhan: message=big
11/18/22, 10:13 PM - Aditya Vardhan: two big brains
11/18/22, 10:13 PM - Aditya Vardhan: i shall spectater
11/18/22, 10:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: change is not necessarily necessary
11/18/22, 10:13 PM - Ryan: Killing people

I don't think it is necessarily bad or good

Depends on the situation and context, even the government may kill people with the right cause
11/18/22, 10:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
11/18/22, 10:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: Exactly
11/18/22, 10:13 PM - Ryan: Sometimes it may be
11/18/22, 10:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: Maybe we can't agree on anything afterall, and that's not a bad thing
11/18/22, 10:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: Killing people may be good
11/18/22, 10:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: Or it may not
11/18/22, 10:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: The axioms limit how much you can think in a sense
11/18/22, 10:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: What if they are incorrect?
11/18/22, 10:14 PM - Aditya Vardhan: sorry if i interupted but you just couruptted my remaining english
11/18/22, 10:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: ü§†
11/18/22, 10:15 PM - Ryan: Why do you have friends?
11/18/22, 10:15 PM - Ryan: @917838968821
11/18/22, 10:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: Some of them tell me interesting things
11/18/22, 10:17 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: its good to have company arouns
11/18/22, 10:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: Some of them make me laugh
11/18/22, 10:17 PM - Aditya Vardhan: why do you have friends
11/18/22, 10:17 PM - Aditya Vardhan: hm mm
11/18/22, 10:17 PM - Aditya Vardhan: do you?
11/18/22, 10:17 PM - Ryan: What makes us want friends?

And what makes us not want friends?

Why is it generally boys being friends with boys and girls being friends with girls?

Is it discrimination? Is it because the differences between the two
11/18/22, 10:17 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: "welcome to the cum zone"
11/18/22, 10:17 PM - Aditya Vardhan: yes you do
11/18/22, 10:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: exactly
11/18/22, 10:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: biochemistry

11/18/22, 10:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: it helps in our survival
11/18/22, 10:17 PM - Aditya Vardhan: chote organism ho kya
11/18/22, 10:17 PM - Ryan: But what about the 3rd question
11/18/22, 10:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: so our brain wants to do it more innately
11/18/22, 10:17 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: loneliness

introvert

No it does not happen always
11/18/22, 10:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: third, nothing

11/18/22, 10:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: it is your choice
11/18/22, 10:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: or is it
11/18/22, 10:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: social pressure
11/18/22, 10:18 PM - Aditya Vardhan: ü§®
11/18/22, 10:18 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: üò®üò®üò®üò®

11/18/22, 10:18 PM - Aditya Vardhan: ü´µü§ì
11/18/22, 10:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: so we avoid friendships with the opposite gender to avoid the social oddities
11/18/22, 10:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: I'm 12

11/18/22, 10:20 PM - Aditya Vardhan: he dosent know
11/18/22, 10:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: we do not trust everyone to the same extent
11/18/22, 10:20 PM - Ryan: What are friends?
11/18/22, 10:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: if anything I have learnt and taught is try to keep the number of people who you trust very low
11/18/22, 10:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: sometimes you don't need to tell everything
11/18/22, 10:21 PM - Ryan: Why?
11/18/22, 10:21 PM - Ryan: Yes
11/18/22, 10:21 PM - Ryan: But when do you need to?
11/18/22, 10:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: calculated decision you mean? most of us don't make calculated decisions, we make emotional decisions
11/18/22, 10:21 PM - Aditya Vardhan changed the group description
11/18/22, 10:21 PM - Ryan: But gain the trust of everyone

Isn't that very useful
11/18/22, 10:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: emotional because friend is social phenomena and social things are related to your brain being a bit different because it's social
11/18/22, 10:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: no
11/18/22, 10:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: you cannot gain the trust of everyone
11/18/22, 10:22 PM - Ryan: Yes

But get as most as you can
11/18/22, 10:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: unless you actively kidnap people and make them go through therapy sessions with you and change their very biochemistry and somehow convince them that you are doing it for the greater good
11/18/22, 10:22 PM - Ryan: Trust is very exploitable I believe
11/18/22, 10:23 PM - Ryan: But can you kidnap all?
11/18/22, 10:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: if we innately think that trust is something to be exploited, i think it still reflects in our behaviour
11/18/22, 10:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: and then it'll be difficult to get trust
11/18/22, 10:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: because you do not deserve it in that case
11/18/22, 10:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: I will avoid the topic of what we deserve and don't
11/18/22, 10:23 PM - Ryan: Trust

Why would you trust anyone?
11/18/22, 10:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: I do not know
11/18/22, 10:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: It is an emotional concept to some extent
11/18/22, 10:24 PM - Ryan: Isn't it quite vulnerable
11/18/22, 10:24 PM - Ryan: Can you fully trust anyone?
11/18/22, 10:24 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes but:

axiom A1: humans are not perfect, mentally or physically, and it is not well defined what a human is
11/18/22, 10:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: keep this axiom in mind
11/18/22, 10:25 PM - Ryan: what is perfect?
11/18/22, 10:26 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
11/18/22, 10:26 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
11/18/22, 10:26 PM - Ryan: What if it is just the expectations which are too high

What if we are perfect but want more?
11/18/22, 10:27 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: me handing in my homework where john os -50.428ft tall
11/18/22, 10:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: axiom A2: Perfection is difficult to quantify, and for all real purposes, we often cannot be perfect. From a very fabric-of-reality POV, it is due to the laws of physics that nothing can be perfect. Perfection in biology is limited by axiom A3. In society, perfection is also not well defined.
A3: biological creatures are limited by their biochemistry


A4: if something is not defined, it is difficult to debate upon the extremities of it
11/18/22, 10:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: okay expectations can be too high
11/18/22, 10:29 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
11/18/22, 10:30 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 How are you comfortable?

How is everyone comfortable?

You are being watched most of time right? At moments, every action of yours is judged and seen by the people

Shouldn't we be careful

Do you think sometimes that what you did was not necessary?
11/18/22, 10:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: Why would you want more if you are truly, truly perfect? The thing is, if you want more, then you probably are quite far away from perfection. A perfect person may be able to understand their limits, or they realize that nothing else is to be achieved if they have achieved perfection

So they'll understand that they are not perfect themselves

 Axiom A4: extremities are difficult to debate upon as true perfection is not defined
11/18/22, 10:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't know, why am I comfortable?

It is difficult for me to quantify
11/18/22, 10:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: It is not a science for me, sometimes I am comfortable and other times, I am not
11/18/22, 10:32 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't know why
11/18/22, 10:32 PM - Ryan: Hmm then perfection is based on perspective?
11/18/22, 10:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: everyone wants to know the answer of how to be near perfect from atleast a mental point of view - being able to argue and reason everything to be comfortable
11/18/22, 10:33 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: 3rd

I don't care what anyone thinks about me and you shouldn't either
11/18/22, 10:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
11/18/22, 10:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: Because it is not defined well
11/18/22, 10:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: Gigachad
11/18/22, 10:33 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?
11/18/22, 10:33 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: fuck yeah
11/18/22, 10:33 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: sorry for bad languahe
11/18/22, 10:33 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: sorry admins
11/18/22, 10:33 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: üëçüèªüòÉ
11/18/22, 10:33 PM - Ryan: If society thinks bad about you, particularly bad

Then you are dead
11/18/22, 10:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: extremities are difficult to debate upon, Axiom A4
11/18/22, 10:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
11/18/22, 10:33 PM - Anant Tiwari: but
11/18/22, 10:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: society does not think bad of him
11/18/22, 10:34 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: maze thodi na aate hai society ko
11/18/22, 10:34 PM - Ryan: Socially boycotted, financially deprived and alone
11/18/22, 10:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: it is difficult for that to be the case for most people
11/18/22, 10:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: it is an extremity
11/18/22, 10:34 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: they can't do anything but "think" bad about you
11/18/22, 10:34 PM - Ryan: I think alone was not needed
11/18/22, 10:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: he is referring to average circumstances which he is likely to experience
11/18/22, 10:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: I can kill you if I hate you enough
11/18/22, 10:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: but I don't
11/18/22, 10:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: so i won't kill you
11/18/22, 10:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: you are my buddy
11/18/22, 10:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: ü§†üëç
11/18/22, 10:35 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: üòÉüëçüèª
11/18/22, 10:35 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: sorry
11/18/22, 10:35 PM - Ryan: Are you sure?

They can do a lot of things

Beat you up in public, burn your house, may prevent you from living comfortably

Just because they don't like you
11/18/22, 10:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes but he's not hitler
11/18/22, 10:35 PM - Anant Tiwari: Fun fact Wernher Von Braun was a nazi
11/18/22, 10:35 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: has this happened to you?
11/18/22, 10:35 PM - Ryan: You can

But will it be worth it?
11/18/22, 10:35 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: someone made their house in swastika shape

and you know what happened next
11/18/22, 10:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: Maybe if the entirety of society also hates him
11/18/22, 10:36 PM - Ryan: But this has happened to people just because discrimination, racism and a lot of social problems exists I think
11/18/22, 10:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes, fair
11/18/22, 10:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: Systematic discrimination
11/18/22, 10:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: Lots of people by the system
11/18/22, 10:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: I think darash meant a few people such as a class of 8th graders disliking him a lot
11/18/22, 10:36 PM - Ryan: A person hates a particular religion and you unfortunately are a part of that religion and then you get unfortunately get put in concentration camps
11/18/22, 10:36 PM - Anant Tiwari: Hmmmm
11/18/22, 10:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: Deja Vu
11/18/22, 10:37 PM - Ryan: Then it matters what society thinks
11/18/22, 10:37 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: whdueuw when
11/18/22, 10:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yee
11/18/22, 10:37 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
11/18/22, 10:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: Such cases happen very frequently
11/18/22, 10:38 PM - Ryan: Hmm

Then we have to be a little careful I think
11/18/22, 10:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: But we are not exposed to them
11/18/22, 10:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: As we are a bit more privileged
11/18/22, 10:38 PM - Ryan: What we speak of, what we do, what we don't do
11/18/22, 10:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: So it is tempting to label those events as extremities which won't happen to you

But they may happen to your Aunt's friend
11/18/22, 10:38 PM - Ryan: Is it our fault when you don't report of something bad?
11/18/22, 10:38 PM - Anant Tiwari: Big brother is watching you
11/18/22, 10:38 PM - Ryan: Are we equally at fault?
11/18/22, 10:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: According to our school, yes
11/18/22, 10:39 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: kab hua ye
11/18/22, 10:39 PM - Ryan: Government, people etc
11/18/22, 10:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: example de raha tha
11/18/22, 10:39 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ahccha
11/18/22, 10:39 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
11/18/22, 10:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: Can you prove to not be under surveillance in extreme cases?
11/18/22, 10:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: Is there anything you can do right now?
11/18/22, 10:39 PM - Anant Tiwari: Maybe over the next month?
11/18/22, 10:39 PM - Ryan: Why?

Didn't the school fail then it identifying and reporting that case

Why is it our responsibility?
11/18/22, 10:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: What if you literally made it the goal of your 2023? Would you manage to hide from big brother?
11/18/22, 10:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes exactly
11/18/22, 10:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: But we'll
11/18/22, 10:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: We are a part of the school
11/18/22, 10:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: The government can't do everything, the society heads
11/18/22, 10:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: So the rest of the society in some cases has a moral obligation
11/18/22, 10:40 PM - Ryan: You can't

If you want to live normally
11/18/22, 10:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: For the betterment of people
11/18/22, 10:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: But in a lot of cases you shouldn't have that obligation
11/18/22, 10:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: Such as you helping enforce bullshit school rules
11/18/22, 10:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: Exactly
11/18/22, 10:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: It doesn't matter if you use Linux or BSD
11/18/22, 10:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: It doesn't matter if your CPU architecture is riscV
11/18/22, 10:41 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: bhosda OS
11/18/22, 10:41 PM - Ryan: We just have to accept it
11/18/22, 10:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
11/18/22, 10:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: You will be under surveillance at all times
11/18/22, 10:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: You do not need a camera to survey everything either
11/18/22, 10:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: DNA Analysis can be used in some cases
11/18/22, 10:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: Or witnesses
11/18/22, 10:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: Anything
11/18/22, 10:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: Many things you don't expect
11/18/22, 10:42 PM - Ryan: Nice
11/18/22, 10:43 PM - Ryan: But then how do murders, thefts, and other crimes take place
11/18/22, 10:43 PM - Ryan: Is the surveillance ineffective?
11/18/22, 10:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: I remember Tom Scott made a video on something like the slight "eeeeeering" noises due to electrical grid in AC which leaves a footprint in audio files which was used to catch criminals
11/18/22, 10:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: Maybe not
11/18/22, 10:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: Maybe it's a "parsing information" issue
11/18/22, 10:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: They just don't bother enough
11/18/22, 10:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: To DNA analyze every crime
11/18/22, 10:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: It's actually not that big brother is watching you
11/18/22, 10:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: It's that big brother is logging you
11/18/22, 10:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: Everything is in a database with many copies, but the data is huge, so you may not be immediately caught
11/18/22, 10:45 PM - Ryan: Hmm

Is it good or bad?
11/18/22, 10:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: But I think the government can find out whether @919999373163 eats meat or not by tracking his accounts as @919999373163 has made the mistake of using similar usernames across his internet presence

Upon big brother's order, the government may choose to force those services to give them all the data

If big brother cares enough, he can probably find that obscure information out
11/18/22, 10:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: Surveillance?
11/18/22, 10:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: It stops crime
11/18/22, 10:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: But there have been many cases of manipulations using that data
11/18/22, 10:45 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: bada bhai
11/18/22, 10:45 PM - Ryan: No the government not bothering enough
11/18/22, 10:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: Oh
11/18/22, 10:46 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
11/18/22, 10:46 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: rip pelota
11/18/22, 10:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: Well I don't think most government officials would go on a murder spree given the chance to
11/18/22, 10:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: Or will they?
11/18/22, 10:47 PM - Ryan: I think a lot of people would commit a lot of heinous crimes if they wouldn't face the consequences
11/18/22, 10:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: The government can bother but maybe it has calculated that its better in some cases not to
11/18/22, 10:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: But those calculations are hard to agree and verify upon
11/18/22, 10:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: Hmmm
11/18/22, 10:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: Honestly?
11/18/22, 10:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: You can pretty easily do that now
11/18/22, 10:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: Drive a car, run over someone and crash at a very high speed so that you do not face the consequences
11/18/22, 10:48 PM - Ryan: Yes I think

People are wierd

We just don't know it because laws, moral education etc exist I think
11/18/22, 10:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: Hmmm
11/18/22, 10:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: So is everyone just a mask?
11/18/22, 10:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: Societal conditioning over their evil?
11/18/22, 10:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: Eh
11/18/22, 10:48 PM - Ryan: Aren't they
11/18/22, 10:49 PM - Ryan: What is holding you from committing the worst crimes

Laws? Morals?
11/18/22, 10:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't want to both
11/18/22, 10:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: Er
11/18/22, 10:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: Does your moral conditioning change part of your biochemistry?
11/18/22, 10:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: I mean I assume that you are a product of your biochemistry
11/18/22, 10:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: We have seen how mental disorders affect people's brain structures
11/18/22, 10:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: Can societal conditioning also not change your brain?
11/18/22, 10:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: And if it does, wouldn't that be a reflection of the "true" you? Because you are flexible because you are your brain and your brain is flexible
11/18/22, 10:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: I think that is the case

You are fluid
11/18/22, 10:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: You don't even know yourself well
11/18/22, 10:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: That's why we need to have a conversation with ourselves
11/18/22, 10:51 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: pelota
11/18/22, 10:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: fastest ball game
11/18/22, 10:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: I made a game called pelota
11/18/22, 10:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: in python
11/18/22, 10:51 PM - Ryan: Would you like to read everyone's thoughts

Input, process,output

Processing is the important part I believe

A lot of things we think of are never said I think

Speeches are processed before but thoughts aren't

If we could hear everyone's thoughts then i think we would know how the person truly is

And I think he/she will be disappointing
11/18/22, 10:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: when I first found out about pyglet
11/18/22, 10:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: lots of balls whizzing by your character and you'd die if you collided
11/18/22, 10:51 PM - Aditya Vardhan: fastest ball in the hood
11/18/22, 10:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: Hmmmm
11/18/22, 10:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: Difficult question
11/18/22, 10:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: I will have to think
11/18/22, 10:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ok your brain processes at many levels, doesn't it?

The intrusive thoughts

They come in some part of your brain

Sometimes they don't get filtered and your conscious brain sees that leakage

It panics because it does not know the extent of how random your thoughts are

But those thoughts, where they are created, are like some object put into the brain machine, some form of random noise (atleast we can approximate it to that based on our current understanding, but ofcourse that's not really true at all)

It would be unfair to call only those random stream of subconscious thoughts as "your brain", as "you"
11/18/22, 10:54 PM - Ryan: I don't know


I think it is pretty wierd and scary

Some people may have extremely disgusting and vulgar vocabulary, but if they think before speaking that, what could be going on in their minds

Am I totally wrong?
11/18/22, 10:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: Maybe the words lose their meaning in the subconscious part

Maybe it depends on the intention
11/18/22, 10:55 PM - Ryan: But if a person is too quiet then it is difficult to know them

If they are too careful with their speeches and words then it feels wierd

What is the thought?
11/18/22, 10:55 PM - Ryan: I am probably very wrong with this topic
11/18/22, 10:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: I personally don't believe in the idea of "people's true self", people are fluid

And brain thought processing is very complex
11/18/22, 10:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes that can be the case
11/18/22, 10:56 PM - Ryan: Meaning?

Or the viewpoint
11/18/22, 10:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: We cannot really focus on one part of the thought system to determine if someone's thoughts are evil
11/18/22, 10:56 PM - Ryan: I don't know
11/18/22, 10:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: I mean
11/18/22, 10:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: When I say "fuck" I don't have any intentions with it
11/18/22, 10:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: It's just a filler word for "oh no" and such
11/18/22, 10:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: Atleast that's what I think of myself, maybe my brain is fundamentally messed up
11/18/22, 10:57 PM - Ryan: I don't know

But if the thoughts are persistent, then we may need to worry
11/18/22, 10:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
11/18/22, 10:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: But they can be changed I think
11/18/22, 10:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: Therapy
11/18/22, 10:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: Despite therapy being a very "external" phenomena
11/18/22, 10:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: I mean from a POV of your brain
11/18/22, 10:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: If it can be messed up from external content
11/18/22, 10:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: It can be fixed too
11/18/22, 10:57 PM - Ryan: There might be a truly disgusting mind within us or around us and we don't know about it

We don't know what others may think of us

Isn't it scary?
11/18/22, 10:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: It's a hard thing though, path of least resistance
11/18/22, 10:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
11/18/22, 10:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: It is not inherently scary for me
11/18/22, 10:58 PM - Ryan: Why isn't it scary?
11/18/22, 10:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: Guide to worrying:

Is there a problem?
No? Then don't worry about it.
Yes?
	- Can you do something about it?
		Yes? Then don't worry about it
		No? Then don't worry about it, you can't change it
11/18/22, 10:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: I saw this from a meme and that has influenced my entire thought process since the beginning of October
11/18/22, 10:59 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
11/18/22, 10:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: that looks poggers buddy
11/18/22, 11:00 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: ,this is incroyanle
11/18/22, 11:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: ye
11/18/22, 11:00 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: its a society
11/18/22, 11:00 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: flats start from 1.cr
11/18/22, 11:00 PM - Ryan: Are you effected by opinions regarding you?
11/18/22, 11:00 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: the lighting was so fricking good
11/18/22, 11:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: Depends
11/18/22, 11:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: Maybe it can harm me
11/18/22, 11:00 PM - Ryan: Body shaming?
11/18/22, 11:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: I will be (affected*) and I might want to do something about it
11/18/22, 11:00 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: a
11/18/22, 11:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: b
11/18/22, 11:01 PM - Ryan: Why does it harm you?

Why do simple words harm you
11/18/22, 11:01 PM - Ryan: Why will it harm us
11/18/22, 11:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: Because words sometimes may have their literal meaning
11/18/22, 11:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: It is hard to quantify when they do
11/18/22, 11:01 PM - Ryan: Does it matter?
11/18/22, 11:02 PM - Ryan: Is the condition bad? Is it harming you
11/18/22, 11:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: Maybe we want to influence those people's thoughts to make them less likely to harm others (who have not introspected in the same way)?
11/18/22, 11:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't get the thought process of people who body shame
11/18/22, 11:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: But maybe those same people who do that can do other vile thinfs
11/18/22, 11:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: Things*
11/18/22, 11:02 PM - Ryan: Why?
11/18/22, 11:03 PM - Ryan: And is it because of people?

How we grew up
11/18/22, 11:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't know
11/18/22, 11:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: Too complicated
11/18/22, 11:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: Brain is tired
11/18/22, 11:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: I cannot think well and my hand is a bit tired from the typing
11/18/22, 11:04 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: <Media omitted>
11/18/22, 11:04 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: zyzz
11/18/22, 11:04 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: grave
11/18/22, 11:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: and as I told AVS - thinking properly seems to be the base of a lot of other things

so thog shall sleep
11/18/22, 11:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: or food
11/18/22, 11:04 PM - Ryan: Is it too late?

Can racist, misogynistic, sexist etc opinions taught since birth change?
11/18/22, 11:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: Well
11/18/22, 11:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: Your brain is quite weird when you are a baby
11/18/22, 11:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: Maybe not?
11/18/22, 11:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: Maybe they can't change
11/18/22, 11:05 PM - Ryan: Children can have pretty disgusting minds
11/18/22, 11:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: Disgusting from whose perspective?
11/18/22, 11:05 PM - Ryan: Not from the children's
11/18/22, 11:05 PM - Ryan: I think
11/18/22, 11:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
11/18/22, 11:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: Terrorists probably think they are doing great things and helping God or whatever
11/18/22, 11:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: We don't
11/18/22, 11:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: We based on our thought axioms say that they harm more people than help
11/18/22, 11:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: So we think they are vile and do atrocious things
11/18/22, 11:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: I agree with this
11/18/22, 11:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: Terrorists are bad
11/18/22, 11:06 PM - Ryan: Children don't have a good and bad

They don't understand it and they are eventually taught it

That's why they can think about pretty disgusting things I think
11/18/22, 11:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
11/18/22, 11:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: @919999373163 what is your opinion on this

11/18/22, 11:07 PM - Ryan: When is a terrorist a terrorist?
11/18/22, 11:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: Hey! Vsauce, Michael here. I am currently a member of a registered terrorist group recognize in 27 different countries. Or am I?
11/18/22, 11:09 PM - Ryan: What if the terrorist group succeeds

The world is now reformed and their social customs are accepted by everyone through force

Who would be able to call them terrorist?
11/18/22, 11:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes exactly
11/18/22, 11:09 PM - Ryan: What is the difference between a freedom fighter and a terrorist
11/18/22, 11:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: Hitler thought he was a brave, great, salient warrior when he was dying

Can happiness be bad for the brain? Can happiness affect your actions negatively?
11/19/22, 7:39 PM - Ryan: Does your brain work when you're happy
11/19/22, 7:40 PM - Ryan: @919999373163 @919818027773 @919454835401 @917838968821
11/19/22, 7:44 PM - Dev: I think so
11/19/22, 7:45 PM - Ryan: What if it doesn't, is it a problem?
11/19/22, 7:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: Work as in?
11/19/22, 7:47 PM - Ryan: According to me, happiness leads to bad decisions I think

I think it is difficult to think before act when you are happy
11/19/22, 7:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: Emotional mind leads to bad decisions
11/19/22, 7:47 PM - Ryan: Work in proper decision making?
11/19/22, 7:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: Happiness is an emotion
11/19/22, 7:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ah
11/19/22, 7:47 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: i focus on happiness at the moment
11/19/22, 7:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: Not necessarily
11/19/22, 7:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes, don't make decisions during that period, just enjoy it because it's a gift
11/19/22, 7:47 PM - Ryan: But when can we be without emotions
11/19/22, 7:47 PM - Anant Tiwari: Never
11/19/22, 7:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: Some emotions are stronger than others
11/19/22, 7:48 PM - Ryan: How to not be sad when you are not happy
11/19/22, 7:48 PM - Ryan: Anger, fear?
11/19/22, 7:48 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: never
11/19/22, 7:48 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: be in the moment
11/19/22, 7:48 PM - Ryan: What doesn't that mean
11/19/22, 7:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't know I have not been properly sad in a while
11/19/22, 7:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: I just forget after a bit that I was sad
11/19/22, 7:48 PM - Anant Tiwari: I usually am too tired at that time to make any decision
11/19/22, 7:49 PM - Ryan: Does*
11/19/22, 7:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: It means don't focus on other things like future decisions
11/19/22, 7:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: Because you probably won't be able to influence them
11/19/22, 7:49 PM - Anant Tiwari: And you'll ruin your happiness to some extent, it depends
11/19/22, 7:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: Do it when you aren't feeling particularly emotional. Not sad or happy or whatever, just ready to do stuff
11/19/22, 7:50 PM - Ryan: Isn't that decision?

You always make a decision, don't you?
11/19/22, 7:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes, kinda
11/19/22, 7:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: Not doing anything is doing something - it is delaying doing something
That can be a decision given time based nature of many decisions
11/19/22, 7:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: But its not that big of a deal generally
11/19/22, 7:50 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: don't think about other things

try not to

eg. let's say you're at a party and enjoying

in the back of your mind you know you have pending assignments, missed calls from your mom, taxes to pay

but if you forget about all these problems that give you sadness and be in the moment think about what's happening, focus on the people, atmosphere, venue or whatever you can ser
11/19/22, 7:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: It's not worth losing sleep over
11/19/22, 7:50 PM - Anant Tiwari: > taxes to pay

11/19/22, 7:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: Oh cowboy power ok
11/19/22, 7:52 PM - Ryan: You can influence yourself in that particular moment

I find that to be an pretty important thing to care about
11/19/22, 7:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: Can you?
11/19/22, 7:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: I don't know
11/19/22, 7:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: I can't do much

11/19/22, 7:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: Maybe
11/19/22, 7:54 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: This message was deleted
11/19/22, 7:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: You deleted this message
11/19/22, 7:54 PM - Ryan: Memory has its own advantages and disadvantages

One disadvantage for you would be that your action would probably be remembered for a long time
11/19/22, 7:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: No
11/19/22, 7:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: Most people don't remember what you have done
11/19/22, 7:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: We all are more interested in ourselves which is fine
11/19/22, 7:55 PM - Ryan: They will forget eventually

But aren't?
11/19/22, 7:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: aren't?
11/19/22, 7:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: What
11/19/22, 7:55 PM - Ryan: We may be

But we are also heavily interested in other people's lives I believe
11/19/22, 7:55 PM - Ryan: *when

Sorry
11/19/22, 7:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: I disagree ü§†
I do not think the same applies to me ü§†

11/19/22, 7:57 PM - Ryan: But only certain people
11/19/22, 7:59 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: N9

11/19/22, 8:04 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: not everyone bro
11/19/22, 8:04 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: are you interested?
11/19/22, 8:04 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: maybe you're
11/19/22, 8:05 PM - Ryan: Why anyone?
11/19/22, 8:07 PM - Ryan: If no one was interested in anyone's life or actions?

How would blackmailing work? Why would people follow vloggers etc
11/19/22, 8:07 PM - Ryan: null
11/19/22, 8:13 PM - Ryan: Do you wish to continue hearing a person who is telling you about what a certain person did?

Is it just our curiosity?

11/21/22, 8:49 PM - Parth: In the dark
11/21/22, 8:49 PM - Ryan: But that isn't passive?

11/21/22, 9:22 PM - Ryan: @917838968821 i still do not agree with the answer provided on LMS for the question "What was the outcome of the Blue Rebellion?"

Can I use the paragraphs on page 36 and 37 for the answer?
11/21/22, 9:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: i told you that the answer is not correct
11/21/22, 9:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: isha mam probably finds a question and pastes answer from google
11/21/22, 9:23 PM - Ryan: But what is the answer?
11/21/22, 9:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: do the research because i have not
11/21/22, 9:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: i cannot help you much with answers as usually i have not done them myself or read the chapter
11/21/22, 9:24 PM - Ryan: Research is not enough I think

Approval is needed

I don't know whether my answer would be correct or not
11/21/22, 9:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: the point is not to do the question but to get knowledge

the research, if done properly will almost absolutely certainly yield useful results and at the very least, will increase your knowledge about it
11/21/22, 9:25 PM - Ryan: But for exam?
11/21/22, 9:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: do the research properly and your answer will be correct
11/21/22, 9:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: doing the research properly is not that difficult from my experience

the chances of it being wrong are very low

and you'll remember what you researched better than reading book
11/21/22, 9:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: so you're already kind of doing the best you could do
11/21/22, 9:26 PM - Ryan: I believe it will require some paragraphs from page 35, 36 and 37
11/21/22, 9:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ok nice
11/21/22, 9:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: Read them, figure out if they are appropriate and write them
11/21/22, 9:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: Do additional checking from internet to ensure your answer is correct
11/21/22, 9:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: And see if Isha Mam scolds or not
11/21/22, 9:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: ab ja ke research karo

11/21/22, 9:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: I cannot approve your answer
11/21/22, 9:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: I have not done the research
11/21/22, 9:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: Don't write it here
11/21/22, 9:31 PM - Anant Tiwari: bhai please
11/21/22, 9:37 PM - Ryan: Can the answer be "In March 1859 thousands of ryots refused to grow indigo. As the rebellion spread, ryots refused to pay rents to the planters and attacked indigo factories armed with swords and spears, bows and arrows. Women turned up to fight with pots, pans and kitchen implements. Those who worked for the planters were socially boycotted and the gomasthas-agents of the planters-who came to collect rent were beaten up. Ryots swore they would no longer take advances to sow indigo nor be bullied by the planters' lathiyals-the lathi wielding strongmen maintained by the planters.After the Revolt of 1857 the British government was particularly worried about the possibility of another popular rebellion. When the news spread of a simmering revolt in the indigo districts,the Lieutenant governor toured the region in the winter of 1859. The ryots saw the tour as a sign of government sympathy for their plight. When in Barasat, the magistrate Ashley Eden issued a notice stating that ryots would no longer be compelled to accept indigo contracts. As the rebellion spread, Intellectuals from Calcutta rushed to the indigo districts. They wrote of the misery of the ryots, tyranny of the planters and the horrors of the indigo system. Worried by the rebellion, the government brought in the military to protect the planters from assaults and set up the Indigo Commission to enquire into the system of Indigo Production. The Commission held the planters guilty, and criticized them for the coercive methods they used with indigo cultivators. It declared that the Indigo cultivation was not profitable for the ryots. The Commission asked the ryots to fulfill their existing contracts but also told them that they could refuse to produce indigo in future. After the revolt, indigo production collapsed in Bengal. But the planters now shifted their operation to Bihar" as an answer
11/21/22, 9:37 PM - Ryan: You must

Who else can?
11/21/22, 9:40 PM - Ryan: @919999373163 @919818027773
11/21/22, 9:40 PM - Ryan: How are you able to get so many marks then
11/21/22, 9:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: peet dunga
11/21/22, 9:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: that is probably an amazing answe
11/21/22, 9:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: lemme read it
11/21/22, 9:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: Nice! Ok you mentioned a bunch of extra names and stuff not mentioned in book so that's great
11/21/22, 9:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: But I don't know if it's correct
11/21/22, 9:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: I think it is
11/21/22, 9:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: If you have spent so much time
11/21/22, 9:41 PM - Ryan: Are you sure
11/21/22, 9:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
11/21/22, 9:41 PM - Ryan: Everything is mentioned in the book I think
11/21/22, 9:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ashley Eden nahi likha tha I'm pretty sure
11/21/22, 9:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: or details about lathi
11/21/22, 9:42 PM - Ryan: There is
11/21/22, 9:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: accha
11/21/22, 9:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: so i mean if you did write from book
11/21/22, 9:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: then probably sahi hoga
11/21/22, 9:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: unless the book is incorrect
11/21/22, 9:42 PM - Ryan: ü•≤
11/21/22, 9:42 PM - Anant Tiwari: kya bhai

11/21/22, 9:43 PM - Ryan: üòÄ
11/21/22, 9:43 PM - Ryan: But I am worried, I believe I will perform a lot worse in this term
11/21/22, 9:43 PM - Anant Tiwari: but dont you think it'll take too much time to write in notebook

you have the knowledge but will writing it in notebook make a difference

maybe, or maybe not

you can write shorter version if you want

or maybe for revision write the whole thing
11/21/22, 9:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: if you get less than me i will literally eat a wooden stick
11/21/22, 9:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: you won't
11/21/22, 9:44 PM - Anant Tiwari: you'll do good
11/21/22, 9:45 PM - Ryan: I will remember
11/21/22, 9:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: and even if you get less, you still deserve more than me because you did far more research than i ever do
11/21/22, 9:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: now next time try to practice writing question without approval
11/21/22, 9:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: verify sources

11/21/22, 9:47 PM - Parth: Are
11/21/22, 9:47 PM - Parth: Marks hi to ha
11/21/22, 9:48 PM - Parth: Chill kro
11/21/22, 9:48 PM - Ryan: Science 9.5
11/21/22, 9:48 PM - Ryan: But you were the best in science?
11/21/22, 9:48 PM - Amritansh: I got 10
11/21/22, 9:48 PM - Parth: Yesüò≠
11/21/22, 9:48 PM - Amritansh: In science
11/21/22, 9:48 PM - Parth: Well i still am
11/21/22, 9:49 PM - Parth: Do red pen se symbol bana ke kuch farak nahi padta
11/21/22, 9:49 PM - Parth: <Media omitted>
11/21/22, 9:51 PM - Anant Tiwari: Chad
11/21/22, 9:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: @919717944490 be proud that you got 7/10 in maths
11/21/22, 9:52 PM - Anant Tiwari: I got 0/10 in maths and coding
11/21/22, 9:53 PM - Ryan: No
11/21/22, 9:53 PM - Ryan: Failures aren't to be proud upon
11/21/22, 9:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: or are they
11/21/22, 9:54 PM - Ryan: If you can't get full marks in a simple ten marker

What are you?
11/21/22, 9:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: either sonal mam troll or darash troll or you messed up somehow
11/21/22, 9:54 PM - Anant Tiwari: Anant Tiwari
11/21/22, 9:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: A human on earth
11/21/22, 9:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: Your marks don't change your species
11/21/22, 9:55 PM - Ryan: Yes humans
11/21/22, 9:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: Plus where could you have messed up in the paper

Calculation error?

Does your calculation test how well you understand the concept
11/21/22, 9:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: No it doesn't
11/21/22, 9:55 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ab chup raho
11/21/22, 9:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: You understand the concept and you often do research
11/21/22, 9:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: Sonal mam gave you 7/10 but I give you 10/10
11/21/22, 9:56 PM - Ryan: But you are kind of useless I think if you can't get full marks

What am I without marks? Nothing

I have no value without marks
11/21/22, 9:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes mere pass red pen nahi but who cares
11/21/22, 9:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: you are not nothing
11/21/22, 9:56 PM - Anant Tiwari: you are an insanely improbable arrangement of molecules and compounds
11/21/22, 9:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: there is self criticism and then there's self depreciation
11/21/22, 9:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: you are definitely something even if you don't get marks
11/21/22, 9:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: but i think its sarcasm so idk
11/21/22, 9:57 PM - Ryan: That is optimistic but

You are still worthless for a student
11/21/22, 9:57 PM - Anant Tiwari: thanks for reaffirming my beliefs
11/21/22, 9:57 PM - Ryan: If you can't get good marks, you failed as a student  I think
11/21/22, 9:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: ryan i give you a 10/10 for being a good student for research had understanding concept
11/21/22, 9:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: i give you a 2/10 for not being able to appreciate self worth
11/21/22, 9:58 PM - Anant Tiwari: that's all im gonna say
11/21/22, 9:58 PM - Ryan: Marks are appreciated by the school, parents, everyone

No one cares about the person
11/21/22, 9:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: i dont care about your school marks
11/21/22, 9:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: parth doesnt care either, he said
11/21/22, 9:59 PM - Amritansh: Same
11/21/22, 9:59 PM - Amritansh: No one cares about the mental emotions
11/21/22, 9:59 PM - Amritansh: Just marks marks marks
11/21/22, 9:59 PM - Anant Tiwari: i do
11/21/22, 9:59 PM - Amritansh: Bro literally except the students
11/21/22, 9:59 PM - Amritansh: I also indeed
11/21/22, 10:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: why do you have to care about the teacher's opinion if his/her opinion is a bad opinion
11/21/22, 10:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: you are doing good
11/21/22, 10:00 PM - Amritansh: Idk
11/21/22, 10:00 PM - Ryan: Why would they

Every emotion is a distraction I believe

Every emotion leads to a constant chain of thoughts that is a distraction
11/21/22, 10:00 PM - Amritansh: Just cope
11/21/22, 10:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: exactly
11/21/22, 10:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: no it is not
11/21/22, 10:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: emotions are real
11/21/22, 10:00 PM - Anant Tiwari: i mentioned this earlier
11/21/22, 10:00 PM - Ryan: I know
11/21/22, 10:00 PM - Amritansh: Ignore and do your thing
11/21/22, 10:00 PM - Amritansh: Xd
11/21/22, 10:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: ok axiom 6: emotions are real, concrete things necessary for human functioning and cannot be ignored due to our brain's biochemistry

i love the word biochemistry, but anyways keep this axiom in mind man
11/21/22, 10:01 PM - Ryan: But they are distracting, pollute judgement and with enough of a certain emotion, a man can cause a lot of harm
11/21/22, 10:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: no
11/21/22, 10:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: emotions do not necessarily lead to that
11/21/22, 10:01 PM - Anant Tiwari: it is your choice to not be able to control your emotions assuming you do not have a mental disorder
11/21/22, 10:02 PM - Ryan: How do we control emotions
11/21/22, 10:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: and assuming you grew up in a decent family it should be your duty to understand the value of emotions and be able to control them
11/21/22, 10:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: i mean
11/21/22, 10:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: you dont control the emotion
11/21/22, 10:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: you control its effects
11/21/22, 10:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: sorry if i misworded
11/21/22, 10:02 PM - Anant Tiwari: anger is an innate thing
11/21/22, 10:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: but murdering someone because you are angry is not that innate of a thing
11/21/22, 10:03 PM - Ryan: It may not cause action but it can still influence thoughts

Useless distracting thoughts
11/21/22, 10:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: in humans atleast
11/21/22, 10:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: and those thoughts' effects can be controlled
11/21/22, 10:03 PM - Ryan: No
11/21/22, 10:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: Ok
11/21/22, 10:03 PM - Ryan: Thoughts can't be controlled
11/21/22, 10:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: I disagree, but I do not know what is the fact
11/21/22, 10:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: mene kab kaha
11/21/22, 10:03 PM - Anant Tiwari: i said thoughts EFFECTS can be controlled
11/21/22, 10:03 PM - Ryan: Oh ok
11/21/22, 10:03 PM - Ryan: Effects surely
11/21/22, 10:04 PM - Ryan: But thoughts are degrading
11/21/22, 10:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: everyone will get angry
everyone will be useless some times
everyone can be affected by the anger and be limited in their ability to do things

but they can usually control the effects to some extent, or atleast make attempts to

unless ofcourse you have a mental disorder, but i dont think you do
11/21/22, 10:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: but they are necessary too for our functioning
11/21/22, 10:04 PM - Anant Tiwari: what can be changed by discussing that
11/21/22, 10:04 PM - Ryan: There are more emotions
11/21/22, 10:05 PM - Ryan: Every emotion can be bad
11/21/22, 10:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
11/21/22, 10:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: but you cant change that
11/21/22, 10:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: cope about it
11/21/22, 10:05 PM - Ryan: For what function?
11/21/22, 10:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: sorry again, cause vs effect
11/21/22, 10:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: if you do not have any thoughts in an awake state then you're probably dead
11/21/22, 10:05 PM - Anant Tiwari: or close to dying i should say
11/21/22, 10:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: so you cant control the mere existence of thoughts, almost never
11/21/22, 10:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: but thats not the goal
11/21/22, 10:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: the goal is to control effects
11/21/22, 10:06 PM - Anant Tiwari: trying to not murder someone when you are angry
11/21/22, 10:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: many people can get extremely angry

but some murder people with far less anger

the common factor in these cases is that they both are angry to some extent

but one of them couldn't control the effect of it in time, maybe due to lack of self introspection or a mental  disorder or something
11/21/22, 10:07 PM - Anant Tiwari: and for the sake of convenient examples, i said that the less angry person still chose to murder someone
11/21/22, 10:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: but people who regularly self introspect and understand and work around their weaknesses are less likely to murder someone for a given "rage coefficient"
11/21/22, 10:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: so that implies that *something* can be done
11/21/22, 10:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: and i think it is your moral duty to *attempt* to do *something* here
11/21/22, 10:08 PM - Anant Tiwari: you probably aren't going to murder someone
11/21/22, 10:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: but you will make bad decisions if you don't know how to control your thoughts
11/21/22, 10:09 PM - Ryan: Duty? Why?
11/21/22, 10:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: we discussed about this earlier
11/21/22, 10:09 PM - Ryan: I forgot
11/21/22, 10:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: i dont think it is important to discuss again for that will not help fulfill the point of this discussion
11/21/22, 10:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: i mean
11/21/22, 10:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: can we atleast agree that generally
11/21/22, 10:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: not killing people is a good thing
11/21/22, 10:09 PM - Anant Tiwari: axiom 7: dont kill people?
11/21/22, 10:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: do you agree with this
11/21/22, 10:10 PM - Ryan: I don't know
11/21/22, 10:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: ok then think and find out
11/21/22, 10:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: i dont think killing people is a good thing generally
11/21/22, 10:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: it depends on the specific case but cmon
11/21/22, 10:10 PM - Anant Tiwari: *generally*
11/21/22, 10:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: so if you agree that not actively harming other people for our selfish needs is good
11/21/22, 10:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: then maybe you will also agree that the effects of thoughts can be controlled based on the scientific observation that people with good mental wellbeing can get very angry but not murder people
11/21/22, 10:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: maybe you'll agree
11/21/22, 10:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: i am not saying you have to
11/21/22, 10:11 PM - Ryan: Don't we always do that?
11/21/22, 10:11 PM - Anant Tiwari: but i think its a good thing for general cases
11/21/22, 10:11 PM - Ryan: Isn't every need selfish?
11/21/22, 10:12 PM - Anant Tiwari: indirectly, yes!
11/21/22, 10:12 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes!
11/21/22, 10:12 PM - Anant Tiwari: but to some extent you can make those needs less selfish
11/21/22, 10:12 PM - Ryan: How?
11/21/22, 10:12 PM - Anant Tiwari: atleast harm people less in a direct sense
11/21/22, 10:12 PM - Anant Tiwari: maybe you'll contribute to  global warming and climate change
11/21/22, 10:12 PM - Anant Tiwari: but atleast i can try to not murder people whom i know
11/21/22, 10:12 PM - Anant Tiwari: its a step in the right direction
11/21/22, 10:13 PM - Ryan: Does it matter

What can a single person do?
11/21/22, 10:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: its a step towards fulfilling my moral obligations
11/21/22, 10:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: well in patna many streets are not that clean
11/21/22, 10:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: if you go away from city center
11/21/22, 10:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: then some places are so abhorrently littered
11/21/22, 10:13 PM - Ryan: Clean city?
11/21/22, 10:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: that's one person at a time throwing their plastic bottle
11/21/22, 10:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: or a random packet
11/21/22, 10:13 PM - Anant Tiwari: over years
11/21/22, 10:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: now imagine a 1000 other people
11/21/22, 10:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: a single person can kill 3-5 people
11/21/22, 10:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: if we did not have any moral values and did not teach anyone any moral values
11/21/22, 10:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: then i assume atleast 5% more people would kill other people
11/21/22, 10:14 PM - Ryan: Is it easy to do bad things, but it is not easy to do good things
11/21/22, 10:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: that's 100s of thousand of people
11/21/22, 10:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
11/21/22, 10:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: but it is easy to make a step in the right direction
11/21/22, 10:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: you cannot change everything in one night
11/21/22, 10:14 PM - Anant Tiwari: *generally*
11/21/22, 10:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: but hey if you make a 0.1% improvement on something per day
11/21/22, 10:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: then you can get 2x better at in in a little less than 3 years
11/21/22, 10:15 PM - Ryan: I think murder wouldn't be the main problem

Every crime would appear to be more frequent I think
11/21/22, 10:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: i am using murder as an example
11/21/22, 10:15 PM - Anant Tiwari: use anything else
11/21/22, 10:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: i dont care about the specific, i dont even care about any crime, i just care a little bit about not actively harming other people
11/21/22, 10:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: can we get 25% of the human population to get 0.1% better at not killing people each day?

Yes! That's moral education

That's why a lot of kids are taught those fables and lessons through poems
11/21/22, 10:16 PM - Anant Tiwari: or you don't necessarily need moral education
11/21/22, 10:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: try to think one reason about why you should not kill someone, spend 3 minutes each day reinforcing that idea in your mind a bit
11/21/22, 10:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: if 25% of the population does that everyday then that's a huge difference
11/21/22, 10:17 PM - Ryan: Hmm law
11/21/22, 10:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: yes
11/21/22, 10:17 PM - Anant Tiwari: many other reasons
11/21/22, 10:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: Hey! Vsauce, Michael here, would you like if i put you into solitary confinement against your will?
11/21/22, 10:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: Probably not
11/21/22, 10:18 PM - Anant Tiwari: It would not be nice
11/21/22, 10:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: so spend 10 minutes a day appreciating your self worth, find atleast one thing even if you think you are useless

maybe according to you, you are useless as a student

but can you atleast do a small thing each day to make life less miserable for others
11/21/22, 10:19 PM - Anant Tiwari: i think you can and you should appreciate that
11/21/22, 10:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: so moral of the story: get 0.1% better at not killing people each day, get 0.1% better at helping people each day etc
11/21/22, 10:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: you will spend an hour and then you still have 15 hours of awake time to study or whatever you feel is important
11/21/22, 10:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: so yes go do that
11/21/22, 10:20 PM - Anant Tiwari: goodnight Ryan
11/21/22, 10:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: <Media omitted>
11/21/22, 10:21 PM - Ryan: No
11/21/22, 10:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: No to what?
11/21/22, 10:21 PM - Ryan: I don't think I can help others in any way
11/21/22, 10:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: huh
11/21/22, 10:21 PM - Anant Tiwari: well you helped me get motivated to study more
11/21/22, 10:22 PM - Ryan: Why?
11/21/22, 10:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: because i realized that i need to do more
11/21/22, 10:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: somehow
11/21/22, 10:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: it just helped m e
11/21/22, 10:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: 0.1% improvement atleast
11/21/22, 10:22 PM - Anant Tiwari: you did that
11/21/22, 10:22 PM - Ryan: No
11/21/22, 10:22 PM - Ryan: You did that
11/21/22, 10:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: and i would have done it later if i did not talk to you
11/21/22, 10:23 PM - Anant Tiwari: thus being more harmful to the world
11/21/22, 10:24 PM - Ryan: You don't know
11/21/22, 10:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: i cannot say for certain what the difference would have been in an alternate timeline
11/21/22, 10:25 PM - Ryan: You still have the potential to be harmful

Everyone has
11/21/22, 10:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
11/21/22, 10:25 PM - Anant Tiwari: i do not claim to deny that
11/21/22, 10:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: but 0.1% better, 0.1% more likely to not do harm
11/21/22, 10:26 PM - Ryan: What you may consider as good

Like studying

Can help you be more harmful with the wrong mindset
11/21/22, 10:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: Yes
11/21/22, 10:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: Exactly
11/21/22, 10:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: But generally
11/21/22, 10:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: It's good
11/21/22, 10:26 PM - Anant Tiwari: I do not really want to discuss any edge cases here
11/21/22, 10:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: Or else it will take too much time and may not be as helpful to us in our general lives
11/21/22, 10:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: We may experience some edge cases but it is not worth losing 30 extra minutes over
11/21/22, 10:27 PM - Anant Tiwari: I am not completely depreciating the usefulness of discussing edge cases but I think there are more important things to be discussed
11/21/22, 10:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: or maybe, temporarily it may be best to not discuss
11/21/22, 10:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: it may be best to implement it in our lives and see the effect
11/21/22, 10:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: try helping yourself or others 0.1% for a few days, and then we will discuss about this topical again
11/21/22, 10:28 PM - Anant Tiwari: Topic*

11/23/22, 5:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: It can
11/23/22, 5:34 PM - Ryan: In size? The zygote?

11/23/22, 5:34 PM - Anant Tiwari: Can it not?
11/23/22, 5:35 PM - Ryan: How and why?
11/23/22, 5:35 PM - Ryan: It's purpose isn't to grow in size I think?

11/23/22, 5:54 PM - Ryan: Maybe you cramped a muscle because of applying too much force
11/23/22, 5:54 PM - Dev: Kuch din me sai ho jayega
11/23/22, 5:54 PM - Ryan: Pressure on the muscles when it is relaxed can be dangerous I think

Why? a person may come in my field of vision,but I would have to look at them to clearly see them

Why?

11/24/22, 2:53 PM - Anant Tiwari: 1) yes
2) yes, but you can detect movement and stuff easily even with limited focus
3) because eye lens, cant focus light coming from everywhere perfectly
4) why not

If you look in your eyes in a mirror from close, you can see your complete field of vision clearly I think

Including nose, eyelashes etc which our brains ignore right?

11/24/22, 7:20 PM - Ryan: @918178057352 can wr live in symbiosis with a plant?
11/24/22, 7:21 PM - Ryan: *we
11/24/22, 7:23 PM - Parth: in a way i guess like we do give them shelters to live like when we plant a plant in our garden we protect them and give water to them and they give us fruits of in some manner we are in a symboisis
11/24/22, 7:24 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: aaj kamaayenga to kal beth ke khaayenga
11/24/22, 7:24 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: haa meri jaaaan
11/24/22, 7:25 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: plants hame kya provide karenge
11/24/22, 7:25 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: food?
11/24/22, 7:25 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: shelter?
11/24/22, 7:26 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: oxygen
11/24/22, 7:26 PM - Parth: yes like some people do eat fruits of their plants
11/24/22, 7:37 PM - Ryan: Hmm is that how symbiosis works?
11/24/22, 7:37 PM - Ryan: Aren't we all living in symbiosis maybe?
11/24/22, 7:38 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: yeah like depending on eachother for certain things
11/24/22, 7:39 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: isn't symbiosis the case with only 2 individuals?
11/24/22, 7:39 PM - Ryan: Yes I think
11/24/22, 7:40 PM - Ryan: But individuals?
11/24/22, 7:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: so we aren't living in a symbiotic environment then
11/24/22, 7:40 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: 2
11/24/22, 7:40 PM - Anant Tiwari: some other people eat their babies
11/24/22, 7:41 PM - Anant Tiwari: cannibal
11/24/22, 7:41 PM - Ryan: Rhizobium lives in a symbiotic relationship with a plant

Rhizobium isn't a single individual? That whole community of the bacteria lives in the symbiotic relationship right?
11/24/22, 7:41 PM - Ryan: And in symbiosis, both are dependent on each other for survival right
11/24/22, 7:41 PM - Ryan: ?
11/24/22, 7:41 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: üòÇ i knew you were gonna come with a retarded response
11/24/22, 7:42 PM - Ryan: But in this case, we can depend on other animals for food
11/24/22, 7:44 PM - Ryan: What if humans develop a system to provide carbon dioxide and water to plants implanted in their body

And the plant produces the food through photosynthesis

Can it sustain itself and the human
11/24/22, 7:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: Plants are not that efficient
11/24/22, 7:45 PM - Ryan: What if we make them?
11/24/22, 7:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: Go ahead
11/24/22, 7:45 PM - Anant Tiwari: Expensive, difficult, dangerous
11/24/22, 7:45 PM - Wernher Von Kerman: jesse, make more plants jesse
11/24/22, 7:45 PM - Ryan: And maybe unnecessary
11/24/22, 7:46 PM - Anant Tiwari: which plants!? ü§îü´¢ü§®
